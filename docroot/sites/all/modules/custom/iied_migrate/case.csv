Approximately 30000 people live in 22 villages in the protected area and depend on the surrounding natural resources for their livelihoods. Before BNPMAB was established, destructive practices like coral mining, cyanide fishing and mangrove cutting were depleting the natural resource base and there was no coordination between local people, tourism operators and park authorities for the management of the park. In the year 2000, BNPMAB was established in response to a decentralisation and reform process in Indonesia. It adopted participatory and consultative approach with all the stakeholders and successfully managed to eradicate destructive practices while safeguarding the natural resource base and improving livelihood opportunities for local communities. Bunaken Concerned Citizen's forum (FMPTNB) represents the local communities in BNPMAB and has one third of total seats on the advisory board with an equal representation from men and women. FMPTNB along with the board has established a multiple-use zonation system that ensures that the conservation, tourism, and villager livelihood functions of the park can be attained in a harmonious way. It has helped to resolve resource use conflicts and villagers have been spared of uncontrolled tourism development. Another partner in this initiative, the North Sulawesi Water sports Association (NSWA) has worked closely with FMPTNB to ensure that the tourism industry provides maximum benefits to local villagers. It provides over 1000 jobs to local youth. FMPTNB has also worked with USAID to develop non tourism livelihood opportunities for local communities. In one such initiative, local women use discarded coconut shells to make charcoal for fuel which is sold in nearby villages to earn extra income and has reduced pressure on mangroves for fuelwood. 30 % of the park entrance revenues are used for the development programmes of the park villages. All these efforts have made BNPMAB a successful initiative which has conserved the marine protected area with improvement of people's livelihood.","Conservation of 400 species of hard coral (with best live coral conditions in southeast asia), mangrove replantation and improvement of habitat","40000 people benefit economically from the park and over 1000 jobs were created for local villagers","CE|PA|JC|RS|PP|NR|LR|","http://www.undp.org/equatorinitiative/pdf/EKZ/2004%20Finalists%20and%20winners/2004-0202_Nom_BNPMAB_Indonesia.pdf",,"Ms. Angelique Batuna, Vice Chair, Bunaken Mgmt.

It is in the catchment of river Ipongo and is traversed by several perennial and intermittent tributaries of the river. It has a population of 5000 consisting of various ethnic communities. Land is in abundance and is managed with customary laws. Most of the people are subsistence farmers. Main constraints to subsistence farming are limited family labour, low inputs, poor infrastructure and insufficient government extension services. In 1994, on the demand of the poor farmers, the Institute of Cultural Affairs Zambia (ICAZ) started the Ipongo Development Programme (IDP). This was a small-scale integrated rural development programme, which dealt with issues of agro biodiversity, environmental awareness, nutrition and sanitation.  Initially, five farmer clubs, each with a membership of 25 farmers, were established. These clubs were trained in sustainable agriculture practices like cover crop growing, composting, green manure and integrated pest management. Extension work was carried out through an informal ‘farmer to farmer’ approach. 375 farmers were trained as community agriculture workers to further the extension work. Community seed banks were established to multiply and distribute local varieties of seeds. IDP promoted cultivation of nitrogen fixing species like Sesbania sesban, sunn hemp and velvet bean with other food crops. A revolving micro credit fund was established for seed, cattle and cash loans. In 1999, a loan of $ 3000 and in 2000, a loan of $ 3000 was given to members for these purposes. Now, the number of clubs has increased to 36 with a membership of 1000 farmers. Crop diversity has increased due to seed multiplication and establishment of community seed supply systems. Land under cultivation has increased from 0.5 ha to 2.0 ha per farmer, which has ensured complete food security for 50% of the participating farmers. 30 to 50% of the farmers have food surplus for local sale.

SCM became the co manager of Mamiraua reserve, which was a Ramsar site and was part of the Amazon Biosphere reserve. As legislation in Brazil was conservative about the use of natural resources of protected areas, SCM worked to evolve a strategy that prescribed the sustainable use of natural resources by the local population and hence combined conservation with poverty alleviation. It advocated and successfully executed this strategy to create 'sustainable development reserves (SDR). In 1998, in addition to Mamiraua, Amana reserve was developed on the same lines into a SDR. Both the reserves in total had 3.5 million hectares of area and involved about 9000 people. All these people lived on river margins in small settlements of around 100 people each. They engaged in fishing, hunting, slash and burn agriculture and timber exploitation. These activities were seasonal, unsustainable and cash flow was low. Surplus of the produce was sold or bartered for other products with local traders at low prices due to lack of organisation and access to regional markets. All these factors created situation of extreme poverty. In 1998, SCM started the Economic Alternatives Programme to reorient traditional resource use to sustainable levels with activities like ecotourism, handicraft production and improvement of agricultural outputs. Local producers associations were created and strengthened. These associations were linked to regional end markets. All these activities have led to increase in local incomes by 50% and in some areas up to 99 %. Due to improvement in living conditions, infant mortality has declined by 53%.

It is shared by Mboro and native communities whose interests are conflicting. Mboro community live in the grazing area and consists of pastoralists. Native population lives outside communal grazing area and consists of farmers. Cattle of Mboro destroyed crops of the framers and farmers encroached on the grazing ground for the expansion of agriculture area, which led to conflicts between the communities. In this backdrop, Itoh community grazing initiative was started in 1992 with an objective to improve the resource efficiency with the judicious use of the available natural resources by integration of crops and livestock in order to limit farmer graziers' conflicts, improve livestock production and the overall livelihood of beneficiary population. The activities carried under this initiative were construction of a live fence around the grazing area to check cattle from straying to the fields, subdivision of grazing land into areas for grazing of cattle, sheep and goat to enable animal graze in rotation, improvement of pasture using forage and multipurpose trees and construction of water supply for human and livestock population. Communities were also trained with modern livestock rearing techniques, nursery establishment, group dynamics and farm management. These activities reduced cattle raids and encroachment incidents by 100% and hence conflicts between the communities were sorted out. Also, it has increased the income of the communities with sale of forage seeds, cattle and goat meat and milk.

Five elders from each of eight farmers associations are democratically elected and represented on Guassa committee or idir, which is responsible for enactment and enforcement of the rules for the resources management. People obtain grasses for thatching, fuelwood and grazie cattle and other livestock in the common area. These resources are primarily used during drought periods, hence providing a coping strategy during the hard times. Festuca grass used for thatching is sold in nearby markets and is an important source of off farm income for people.

It targeted about 11000 people of these divisions who lacked permanent water points such as hand dug wells or boreholes. Average distance between permanent water points in this area is 70- 150 km. As there was no potential for ground water development in this area, PISP focussed on rain water harvesting through community based technologies. Underground water tanks and sand dams were constructed to conserve, recharge and store the rain water.

Before that, communities use to sell timber and other forest products to middlemen at low prices as there was no access to markets. People had to walk for four hours to reach a road. The community was trying to contract with logging companies to exchange the forest timber with a road. But once Cross River National Park was created in 1990, conditions changed thanks to the help of park authorities. After proper trainings, people have started selling timber and other forest products to the city market with much higher profits. Communities have also introduced a tax system for middle men for the harvest of non timber forest products. All the money goes to community bank accounts, which is then used for community development works. So far, with this money, a 30 km long metal road linking the communities to market was built, contribution towards the health centre in the village and payment of university and school fees were made.

Four ethnic groups of the region started the initiative in 1996 when Namibian government passed an enabling legislation which allowed communities to obtain conditional rights over utilization of wildlife area and establish entrepreneurial activities. Torra with a private partner Wilderness Safari Namibia (WSN) initiated Damaraland Camp joint Venture, a luxury tent lodge for ecotourism business. In the year 1999, conservancy hired a professional hunter to sell its hunting quota through trophy hunting. Since 1996, all these activities have produced more than N$ 1.6 m in benefits to the conservancy. Torra has adopted an equitable benefit distribution policy with its members. In the year 2003, about 300 of its members were given N$ 630 each. Local schools were given N$ 30000 and a photocopier.

KAFRED believes that tourism can be an important tool for the conservation. Hence, organisation has been promoting tourism in the area through Uganda Community Tourism Assosciation (UCOTA) and other private tourist companies. A committee of seven members, elected in general assembly for two years, manages the affairs of KAFRED. Due to its organised efforts, the organisation received an average of 1000 visitors with an income of 5.8 million Uganda Shillings per year between 1999 and 2001.

Aim of CHIEHA is to promote cultural and natural heritage in the area through fostering the spirit of communal participation, sharing information among stakeholders and creating awareness about sustainable use of natural resources. It runs three programmes of earth healing and land care, income generation, and environmental awareness to achieve its aim. In earth healing and land care programme, afforestation on degraded lands and plantation of vertiver in gullies are undertaken so as to check soil degradation and restore the land. Community nurseries of Vertiver and other indigenous species are established to raise the seedlings at local level. More than five hectares of land have been rehabilitated under this programme. Under the income generation programme activities like eco and ethno tourism, Kigelia African juice production, bee keeping and eco agriculture are taken. In ecoagriculture projects, more than 150 household participate in revival of traditional crops of small crops like sorghum, cowpeas, millets and ground nuts. With this crop yield has doubled from 1.5 tonnes per household per year to 3.5 tonnes per household per year. Income from sale of these crops has increased from nil to Z$ 350000 per household per year. It has helped to restore traditional varieties of cowpeas, sorghum and groundnut and hence, has helped to restore agro biodiversity. At the same time, more than 50 households participate in ecotourism and non timber forest product processing. An average of Z$ 20 million trickle down to community as benefits from the use and sale of biodiversity products such as crafts, traditional medicines, honey, fruits, and worms among others. Along with income generation, these activities have motivated to save and manage 220 hectares of local forest. Likewise, through environmental awareness programme, CHIEHA has reached more than 50000 people at the regional, national and international level, which has resulted in sustainable management of 10000 square km of land.

Since its operation began, it has had a positive impact on the local economy. Home Stay programme in the year 2002 registered 1000 bed nights and earned revenue of over RM 104,000. In a community where average per capita annual income ranges between RM 3600- RM 9600 per year, the program made a significant contribution to sustainable income generation and poverty reduction. The activities provided employment to over 100 people of community on a part time basis. These alternative sources of income have reduced the illegal practice of timber extraction and hence, there is less pressure on the forest. This programme has also set a community fund, which has gained over RM 25,000. This fund is being used to offer micro credit for community participants to improve household toilet facilities and hygiene, household water supply, electricity supply, and roofing. This initiative has generated awareness in the local community about forests and biodiversity. In 1998, when there were forest fires in surrounding Supu Forest Reserve, community assisted forest department in putting these off. Soon after, MESCOT restored around 50 ha of swamp forest land by panting around 30000 samplings. In addition, the community has set up a strict code of conduct for the tourists visiting the area to maintain the socio-cultural and environmental sustainability of the area.","These alternative sources of income have reduced the illegal practice of timber extraction and hence, there is less pressure on the forest.

The Maisin community has a population of around 3000, which is distributed in 9 villages spread across Collingwood Bay located along the northeast cost of the country. The Maisin ancestral lands cover nearly one million acres forming the watershed of five major rivers. In the year 1999, the access rights of this land were sold to a foreign corporation through fraudulent arrangement, which wanted to raise oil palms on this land after clearing the forest. The organisation made community aware about this deal. With the help of Maisin community, it filed a case in the court. Simultaneously, it lobbied with local government officers, international supporters and press. In the year 2002, court gave its verdict in favour of Maisin people and restored their rights over their ancestral land.

In these areas, farmers traditionally grew paddy. Along with it, reed used to grow on its own under natural conditions. It provided farmers with the material for weaving of mats, baskets and other domestic vessels and containers. These paddy fields and reed beds were essentially wetlands and were home to a wide range of species, including birds, fish and numerous insects. However, with the introduction of Green Revolution technologies and the advent of chemical inputs, this biodiversity got negatively affected. Due to the use of polythene and other synthetic materials there was a drastic decline in the use of rush and reed. This process resulted in a decline in the biodiversity of rush and reed and in the productivity of the soil, eventually leading to decline in the quality of rural life. <BR>Acknowledging these problems, the organisation started its programme to promote traditional agricultural practices and chemical free agriculture along with conservation and diversification of reed beds. It trained 18 small groups made up of five persons each in appropriate agricultural technologies. It focused development of micro land unit as a viable and sustainable economic entity, consisting of the paddy field, the reed bed and home garden. Along with reed and rush plants, leafy greens were introduced which enhanced biodiversity and had medicinal and food values. Selected farmers were trained in techniques such as vermiculture, use of liquid fertilizers and compost as alternatives to chemical fertilizers. A group of twenty people were offered training in traditional crafts. For the sale of these crafts, a building complex was constructed with a sales outlet, a training centre and a show room. Leadership roles in agricultural aspect was taken by the older generation of farmers who contributed immensely about traditional practices. The craft training programme was initiated by the elderly women of the region who were familiar with the weaving practices.<BR>These efforts led to the conservation of 12 rush and reed varieties which were threatened. Environmentally friendly agricultural practices improved biodiversity in general. Now there are more species of birds, insects and other organisms in the area. It also improved people's incomes. People, who are engaged only in reed cultivation, have an additional income of Rs. 5000-7000 annually without much additional effort. Paddy cultivation now yields Rs 6000-7000 annually as input costs have come down. People now have vegetables for their consumption, which has raised the nutrition status and saved people Rs. 3000–4000 annually. People engaged with crafts earn Rs. 1500–1600 per month in addition to their income from other sources. Thanks to the additional incomes and improvement in local environment this programme has become self sustaining.","Around 12 rush and reed varieties, which have been threatened with extinction, have been conserved in situ. An increase in species, in particular birds, insects and other life is evident in these agricultural units as well in their immediate environments. Environmentally friendly agricultural practices and a committment to a diverse agricultural unit have naturally had a positive impact on biodiversity in general.","Even those who only engaged in cultivating reeds have, within minimum effort, been able to garner an additional Rs.5,000 to Rs.7,000 annually. The home gardens too provide an additional saving of Rs.3,000 to Rs.4,000 annually.

Mangrove forest area of this region had declined alarmingly from 48000 ha to 4800 ha over the years due to logging concessions and other commercial factors like shrimp farming. It also resulted in decline in fish and crab resources, hence affected the livelihoods of the local people. In the year 1986, concerned with the logging practices and shrimp farming, people of Pred Nai formed a group. They destroyed the watergate, which was used to block sea water in order to create shrimp farms. Soon, logging concessions were also stopped. They developed a forest management plan by mapping all the resources. In tune with their plan, villagers started planting denuded mangrove area. They also implemented crab harvesting regulations with a ban on harvesting during their reproduction period in October. A crab bank was established to increase production of the more economic species like mud crab. After a few years of regulation and management, there has been increase in harvest of grapsoid crab from 5kg/ harvest to 8-10 kg/harvest. Now Pred Nai community is processing their products in crackers, wine and other items for sale. With all these activities, income of the community has doubled. A community saving group has been established with 60 members and a fund of 3 million Baht. Biodiversity in the area has also considerably increased.

CABI is involved in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development initiatives in the region, which is under considerable pressure from expanding agriculture and industries. In the year 1995, with the help from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), CABI proposed the government to create Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (KINP) and subsequently assumed the responsibility to co manage the park creation. CABI is the only indigenous initiative in Americas, where a traditional indigenous organisation shares fundamental administrative and financial responsibilities with the government. In yet another initiative in 1996, CABI successfully advocated the concept of indigenous territory as a form of land ownership, to get it included in Bolivia's new agrarian reform law. In 1997, in accordance with the new law, CABI presented a territorial demand for a 'Tierra Communitaria de Origen' (TCO) of 1.9 million hectares adjacent to KINP. CABI established the Ivi Iyambae Foundation and started Kaa-Iya project in conjunction with WCS and USAID Bolivia to promote institutional strengthening and the long term sustainable management of the KINP and TCO. This project has focussed on sustainable use of natural resources and selected Izoceno people have been trained to assume responsibilities for natural resource use through implementation of management plans for individual species, group of species and TCO in general. Sustainable commercial resource use alternatives, like fish flour by women's groups and collared peccary Tayassu tajacu skins by hunters, have been initiated. In an important deal with a privately sponsored Bolivia-Brasil gas pipeline project, a private fund worth US$ 1 million supporting the park and a development plan worth US$ 730,000 for indigenous peoples, were established. This fund enabled CABI to cover over half budget for the park from 1998-2000. Under the development plan, a range of development activities like hand pumps to ensure water supplies to households and community livestock ranches based on revolving credit systems were established. CABI has also implemented an environmental education programme in schools. All these efforts have led to the protection of large tropical dry forest area of 340000 sq. km. with conservation of important species such as the jaguar and the endemic Chacoan peccary, CABI is implementing the management plan in community lands outside park on the lines of park management plan in order to conserve endangered species like Chacoan guanco.

Its purpose is to reduce poverty and malnutrition, reforest the streams and river banks, protect the ancestral lands of this marginalised ethnic group, protect the environment and biodiversity and empower these neglected communities. To achieve these goals, it has initiated several projects linked to reforestation and agriculture diversification. It has initiated a plantation of wild vine, locally known as balaire, which is used for weaving instruments for traditional cooking. This is an integral part of Garifuna culture but over the years, with the rampant deforestation by non-Garifuna ranchers, loggers and others, there was no longer an adequate supply of this vine. The organisation taught the communities how to grow this vine using transplantation method. In another project, the organisation is working with high school students to reforest the beaches with wild fruit plants like sea grapes, almonds, camacamas, nance, cashew etc. These plants will not only help stabilise the beach against erosion but will also provide a more balanced nutrition for young people. In addition to these projects, the organisation has also started diversification of crops with fruit trees as well as plants like ginger; supports the rescue of the traditional root crops of Garifuna, like trao root, red grow yams, arrow root and sweet potato; trains farmers in organic composting and organic pesticides and provides tools to be lent out from the communal tool bank. The organisation has helped farmers to organise regular farmer markets to sell their produce in the towns.

Simultaneously, it is one of the poorest countries where 80% of the labour force is employed in agriculture, including fishing, hunting and forestry. In the last twenty years, increase in population, unemployment and poverty have led to deforestation, soil erosion, coral reef destruction and over exploitation of fish and other marine resources. In 1995, concerned with the degradation of the ecosystem and fast depletion of their resources, ten villages approached the government to have their offshore waters designated as Marine Park. In 2001, 404 square km of the southern zone of Moheli, which included rocky areas, offshore islands, coral reefs and scattered mangrove strands. Through extensive consultations with villagers, fishermen, community groups and resource users, agreements were signed between the government and each of the villages that lie within the protected zone. Rights, responsibilities and regulations were clearly defined. A park management committee was established with representation from all villages and government to manage the activities and finances of the park. Local people were trained and employed as 'ecoguards' for awareness raising and monitoring. The park was divided into a multiple zone use system, and unsustainable harvesting practices, like the use of dynamite and poisons were banned. Sustainable harvesting practices have led to an increase in fish catch from 160 kg/month to over 300 kg/month. Revenues for 250 fishermen working in the park have doubled. Simultaneously, ecotourism was promoted to create alternative livelihood opportunities for local people. An ecotourism lodge was put in place along with other tourism facilitation measures. It led an increase in number of tourists from 75 tourists per village per year in 1998 to 140 in 2001, and it is expected to rise to 200 soon. Other business activities like handicrafts and tourist guide service have grown up. In total 30 new jobs have been created. Biodiversity of the marine park has also significantly improved over the years. There has been a 35%increase in the number of recorded alive coral reefs. Turtles are now frequenting 25 additional beaches. Starfish and crustaceons are now bountiful. Rare coelacanths have also been found in the vicinity of Comoros island.","There has been a 35%increase in the number of recorded alive coral reefs. Turtles are now frequenting 25 additional beaches.

This wet land has a biodiversity rich UNESCO biosphere reserve known as Waza National Park, which is home to animals like elephant, roan antelope, red fonted gazelle, giraffe, lion, jackal and hyena. This flood plain is harvested for fish, agriculture crops, livestock production and tourism and hence is very important for the livelihood of the local people. However, in the year 1979, when a dam was constructed on the Logone River, the main source of water for the flood plain, the whole ecosystem was disturbed. The dam severely reduced the extent of flooding over the flood plain, and fisheries became over exploited. It also affected the supply of water, with severe consequences for livestock rearing. Wildlife numbers fell due to a lack of dry season grazing and surface water. This led to a mass migration of the impoverished fishermen, farmers and herders. In the year 1994, the Committee for the Support of Conservation and sustainable Development Initiatives (CACID), a well known NGO brought together government organisations, residential and settled communities, traditional and administrative authorities and various private sector bodies such as hotels and tourist agencies to rehabilitate the flood plain. Roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders were well defined. On the basis of an ecosystem evaluation, a water management plan was made. Based on this plan water was released from the Logone area for the flood plain. Simultaneously, communities were involved in the management of Waza National Park and were provided access to the resources. An ecotourism plan was developed. In addition, 37 wells were established in 33 villages for providing water to villagers, which reduced the incidence of diarrhoea by 70%. These activities had other positive impacts on reducing the poverty and conservation of biodiversity in the area. Due to the availability of water in flood plains, rice can be grown and stocks of fish have improved, which in turn has increased food security and nutrition. Ecotourism has provided alternative livelihoods to the communities. Women are involved in catering and food processing, while men are improving housing and village facilities. 40% of the income from ecotourism is invested in development of the park's coastal villages.

Honey Care is promoting bee keeping in arid and semiarid rural areas of Kenya, traditionally considered beekeeping regions. This is an easy, low input livelihood option, requiring just hives and some other equipment. Company manufactures and supplies hives and related bee keeping equipment to organisations, communities and individuals. It also provides free training in bee keeping. So far, it has involved 2000 farmers and over 10000 hives have been produced either on a loan or on cost sharing basis through a number of local organisations. Through 'Money for Honey' scheme, company gives a guarantee to purchase the honey on a fair price. A farmer can earn about US$ 200-250 per year from four hives. Company has also developed a micro leasing or hire-purchase scheme, to allow people who can not afford to buy equipment outright to start beekeeping themselves. This has enabled poorest of farmers to earn money without needing any start up capital. Though beekeeping is considered an individual activity, in many communities it has brought farmers together, sharing equipment and learning from each other's experiences. It has a positive impact on biodiversity as well. Through sustainable income generation, natural resource rich areas are protected from over exploitation and encroachments. Also, under 'Bees for Tress' scheme, honey is bought at premium from locations where trees are being planted and farmers can be given hives as direct and immediate incentive. Bees also perform an ecological function of pollination, increasing biodiversity.","Through sustainable income generation, natural resource rich areas are protected from over exploitation and encroachments.

This area was once overgrazed and degraded. Incidents of cattle theft and banditry were common. However, in 1996 a community based ecotourism initiative changed the conditions of the area. With the funds from Kenya Wild life Service, IL Ngwesi tourist lodge was started which made it a first community owned and managed tourist destination. Now, this ranch operates as a community owned trust with a natural resource management committee responsible for its management and it employs 28 people from the community in different jobs. The stable conditions created through the trust and the clear responsibility to protect and maintain wilderness area have provided positive incentives for the community. Apart from providing salaries to the workers, revenues of around US $ 80000 earned through ecotourism have been invested back in the communities to pay for education, infrastructure and medicines. Due to investment in infrastructure this area has become safe and the community no longer fear bandit raids. Now, the community has access to emergency health care through radio and a vehicle. Due to prohibition of cattle from the area and increased protection from poaching, populations of wild animals have increased.

Manambolo valley of Madagascar is located between two national parks and, with an area of 7500 ha, it forms a continuous, long stretch of intact rainforest. Prior to colonisation by the French, natural resource use in this valley was governed through the traditional Dina system, where elders of the community took the decisions in consultation with ancestors. But the colonial administration did not recognise the traditional system and established the Department of Water and Forests (DWF) to control natural resources. This led to a breakdown of traditional rules of resource use, which in turns resulted in over exploitation of the forests for commercial and agricultural purposes by outsiders as well as local people. Degradation of the forests and its impact on land productivity prompted government to revive the traditional management system. In the mid 1990s, with the assistance of World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Association of Manambolo Natives (FITEMA) was created. Dina was recognised under Malagasay law. It provided the community member legal power to control their resources. Soon, FITEMA took control of the natural resources of the valley and revived Dina system. DWF built the capacity of FITEMA members by imparting technical skills through trainings. Now, through volunteers of community association, all entrants to parks are monitored and entry fee is collected from the tourists. 50% of all park entry fees is returned to local residents for community development projects. With the community control, deforestation and erosion have been virtually eliminated. Samplings of native species are raised in local nurseries and plantation has been undertaken. Villagers have channelled mountain streams using a specially constructed irrigation system based on clay dams. Due to availability of water, off season crops like potatoes, beans, and cabbage have been introduced. Increased yield with increase in crop diversity has improved the food security. Alternative income generation schemes like bee keeping and honey production have been introduced, which have generated extra incomes. Instead of being simply viewed as source of raw material to 'use before others', community now has a common vision for the use of forest.","With the community control, deforestation and erosion have been virtually eliminated.

Traditional healers of the community known as Plathis have knowledge of medicinal properties of flora and fauna of the region, and each generation passes this knowledge to the next generation orally. During a field survey, one scientist from Tropical Botanic Garden and Research institute (TBGRI) realised that tribe had knowledge of anti fatigue and stress relieving properties of Arogyapacha plant. The scientist isolated 12 active compounds from the plant and produced a scientifically verified and standardised herbal formulation called Jeevani. Arya Vaidya Pharmacy, a private company was given a licence for a period of seven years to produce the drug for US$ 50000 as licence fee plus 2% royalty. It was decided that 50 percent of the licence fee and royalty would go to Kani tribe. A community organisation, Kerala Kani Samudaya Kshema Trust was established for the disbursement of money, the implementation of development projects and to involve the entire community. It comprised of a general body with adult tribals chosen from 30 Kani settlements, an executive committee representing all the tribal colonies and a 14 member governing council. Trust deposited money in the bank and its interest was used for community welfare programmes like insurance for pregnant women and to cover accidental deaths, and providing financial support to poorer Kanis for education and marriage purposes. This programme is benefiting over 16000 people from over 700 families. It was decided that plant will be cultivated in the areas surrounding the reserve forests to supply the large quantities of the raw material. To facilitate this arrangement, a pilot scheme for cultivation of the plant was carried out with support from the Integrated Tribal Development Programme supported by the government from1 994 to 1996. 50 families were given around $50 each for cultivation of the plant. TBGRI was to buy five tonnes of these leaves per month from the families and supply them to the company for production of Jeevani. People were trained to harvest only leaves of the plant for continuous supply of the raw material throughout year. Through this scheme, roughly half the Kanis secured employment and were trained by TBGRI on various aspects of cultivation and harvesting of Arogyapacha to ensure that the plants were not over harvested. This initiative has empowered the Kanis to protect, preserve and maintain their traditional knowledge, and the sustainable use of biological resources has resulted in benefiting the local and global community.","Community is now sustainbly cultivating and harvesting the Arogyapacha plant.","The local community has got half of the US$ 50000 as licence fee in addition to half of royalty.

People of the community live in longhouses, which are traditional centre of governance and house several extended families. In the 1980s, forests of this area were given to logging companies, which created havoc on the local environment and livelihoods. Valuable forest resources got severely depleted. Pollution and siltation of the rivers adversely affected the water supply and fish catch. Irregular and frequent floods destroyed crops. Logging companies benefited a few individuals of the community, which created disharmony among the members. In the year 1989, around 100 people of the community separated from the Uma Bawang Residents' Association (UBRA) and built a separate longhouse to lobby against the depletion of natural resources and prevailing injustices. A democratically elected board was created to manage the association. UBRA started protesting against the logging. It blocked the logging road to their forest. But under government force, blockade was ended. However, UBRA continued its protest with more blockades. Simultaneously, with the help of a USA based non governmental organisation, The Borneo project, UBRA started mapping its forests with an aim to communicate its traditional rights over the forest to the government. This enabled local people to regain control of the reserved areas of their communal forests through court cases. These resource maps have also been used to demarcate boundaries of individual land plots and hence have reduced the conflicts between the land owners. In addition to the resource management, UBRA initiated a wide variety of new skills and activities that provide cash income to people. They started a communal rice farm and bank. Harvest from a communal farm is put in communal bank and anybody who does not have sufficient yield can borrow from the bank. Likewise, a communal rice mill was established to service the community with minimal charges. Pig rearing and fish rearing were started for better food and income. In the year 1992, a reforestation programme was launched, where people planted thousands of local species on the fringes of communal forest. In the year 1997, 8000 teak samplings were planted on private lands for income purposes. In the year 2002, again reforestation was done with 9000 new seedlings. Trees from earlier plantation have grown to an average height of 5 meters and a girth of 0.5 meters. Alternative activities have generated additional incomes and have increased food security in the community.

It is adjacent to Khao Yai National Park, which is home to 153 animal species and is a unique tropical system. Agricultural households are characterised by extreme poverty, low education and lack of farm management skills. Access to services such as medical care, education, training and credit is limited, so people often borrow from moneylenders at 120-240% of interest rates. People resoredt to illegal logging, hunting endangered species and unsustainable farming methods to escape the cycle of debt. This has resulted in extreme pressure on the park. In the year 1985, Population and Community Development Association (PDA), a well-known NGO of Thailand established a Community Based Integrated Rural Development Centre (CBIRD). CBIRD set up a group called the Environmental Protection Society (EPS) for managing the debts and conservation of biodiversity. EPS started loans to members at a rate of 12 percent for cash crops and 9 percent for the activities that were ecologically beneficial. In return, members agreed to stop cutting trees and poaching in the national park. Community was trained in reforestation, irrigation and sustainable agriculture with the help of government agencies. A carbon fund has been established to provide financial incentives to the community to replant trees and rehabilitate forests on public lands and in degraded areas. Under this scheme, villagers are now reforesting plots of public lands, which were earlier being used for growing cash crops. Under agriculture improvement, mini farm and vegetable bank schemes have been introduced. In mini farm scheme, a mixture of crops with high market value such as mushrooms, field crabs, chicken, ducks and frogs are raised on small plots of land. In vegetable bank scheme, irrigation systems are installed for collective cultivation of vegetables. The villagers pay installation costs over the years. CBIRD has also facilitated community's access to markets. All these efforts have nearly doubled the income of the community and many members are free of debt now. Due to the improvement of livelihoods, migration to cities has been checked. Community participation has led to a decline in Illegal logging in the park by 75% and many rare species of the park, including elephant and tiger, are now more secure.","Community participation has led to a decline in Illegal logging in the park by 75% and many rare species of the park, including elephant and tiger, are now more secure.

Disappearance of species like manatee or sea cow alarmed the community, which, with the help of a grassroots level organisation called Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (TIDE), advocated for the area to be declared a marine reserve. In 2000, the government of Belize declared the area as Port Honduras Marine Reserve (PHMR) and TIDE was made its co-management authority. Demarcation buoys were put to mark the boundaries of reserve and a ranger station was built at a strategic location to stop damaging fishing practices such as the use of gill nets, cast and drag anchors, touching and removing the coral. Fishermen were provided more sustainable fishing equipment. The reserve was divided into three zones, namely general use zone, conservation zone and preservation zone. Local fishermen were trained as rangers. Tourism was promoted in collaboration with private companies. TIDETours was established to support micro enterprise and ecotourism training. So far, it has trained 50 former fishers and hunters to serve as tourism brokers in fly fishing, kayaking, scuba diving and other activities.

These form part of Mandira Neighbourhood Extractive Reserve. Demand and extraction of oysters have dramatically increased since 1970s, which has led to a decline in stocks of the oysters. Despite an increase in demand and harvesting, living conditions of local communities did not improve as the middlemen pocketed most of the profits. In 1997, with the help of The Forest Foundation and Fisheries Institute, traditional oyster pickers were organised into the Cananeia Oyster Producers cooperative (Cooperostra). The main objectives of the cooperative were to eradicate all aspects of illegal oyster exploitation, optimise extraction, increase income of local community and protect the mangroves. Members agreed to implement laws to protect oyster reserves and enforce community regulations. With the financial and technical help of government and international organisations, Cooperostra researched techniques for production of better quality oysters and started producing high quality and healthy to eat oysters. Federa Inspection Service (FIS) certified quality and hygiene of the product. This increased the price of the produce. To support the production, the cooperative has established nurseries where oyster can be cultivated and harvested. Most of the produce is sold through retail outlets in Sao Paulo. Production has increased from 15405 dozen oysters in 2000 to 39,225 dozens in 2001. Due to the high quality of the produce, prices have tripled, which has increased producers' profits. Increase in incomes and production in nurseries have reduced the working days for the producers, which in turn have reduced pressure on natural resources. Community management has led to more rigorous monitoring and endangered species of oysters are no longer extracted.","Increase in incomes and production in nurseries have reduced the working days for the producers, which in turn has reduced pressure on natural resources.

But due to an increased use of plantation rubber, demand for natural rubber has gone down affecting the livelihoods of the local people. As a result people started clearing the forest and raising cattle herds. However this did not solve their problems. In the 1990s, some rubber tappers of the community contacted the shop Eco Mercado, which specialised in sale of eco products. They showed them saco encauchado, a waterproof bag traditionally used by tappers for carrying latex and their personal belongings. This product became an instant hit and 500 bags were sold at earth summit in Rio in 1992. But soon it was realised that to compete in the market, an upgrade in the technology was required. In the year 1994, with the development of a new production technology, AmazonLife Company was started. With the help of producers associations a new product of international standard, Treetap, was developed which could be used to make bags, brief cases and other products. In order to invest in the product technology and in the infrastructure of the production areas, company obtained a loan from the Brazilian National Economic and Social Development Bank (BNDES). A production centre was established in the Amazon, where families from villages were trained and provided start up material by the producers associations. Producers, associations and the company worked together to produce Treetap and promot it in the market. Amazonlife made consumers aware of the importance of products from sustainable resources. Now, this product is supplied to many European countries. Around 200 households work in 32 production units with in Amazon, produce 40000 sheets of rubber laminates every year and sell it at ten times the previous price. Everyone involved in the production is offered a decent wage and tappers are co-owners of the patented process. This has resulted in an economic uplift of these households with an improved access to citizenship and credit. Unsustainable practices of forest use have been checked, which has led to the conservation of 900,000 hectares of wild forest.","Unsustainable practices of forest use have been checked, which has led to the conservation of 900,000 hectares of wild forest.","Around 200 households are involved in production and everyone involved in production is offered a decent wage and tappers are co-owners of the patented process.

Around 6500 people live in the watershed area, which covers 7000 hectares in 23 rural districts of the region. As this is a hilly region, most of the people practice agriculture on steepy slopes in small farms. Not so long back, farming families were facing economic hardship, lack of education, health and credit services, inadequate agricultural infrastructure and food supply in the summer. Farmers practised monoculture and cut trees to sell and produce charcoal as an additional source of income. It led to soil erosion and loss of agricultural productivity. Concerned with these problems, Colombia's national agency for integrated Rural Development (DRI) started an initiative to bring all the stakeholders together for the development of the watershed. An inter institutional consortium for sustainable agriculture in hillsides (CIPASLA) was constituted with an alliance between 16 government, nongovernmental organisations and community. A group known as ASOBESURCA representing different communities of the watershed was established. It represented communities on the board of CIPASLA. Resource map and management plan of the watershed was created with the help of communities. Farmers created buffer zones to protect water sources, built wire fences around mountain springs, planted tress and a new variety of summer resistant grass to check soil erosion. They set aside 120 hectares of land and were in the process of fencing off another 60 hectare for the conservation of catchment area. Different research committees from the community were established to diversify agriculture. Soon these committees came up with certain species like plaintan, blackberries, new varieties of banana, bean and cassava, which were successful in the local conditions. These crops diversified agriculture and increased productivity and food security. CIPASALA also arranged loans for small agro enterprises. A women's cooperative was formed which commercialised a native flower. Likewise, group of people were trained and assisted in establishing a milk and cheese enterprise. All these activities have increased food security and income of the people.

The second largest river of the country, Cauto flows through the province and forms the Cauto river basin which is the largest and most important water reserve of the country. Over the years, large areas of forests in the basin were cleared for agriculture, cattle and charcoal production. This led to negative environmental impacts. Vegetation of the basin dried up, indigenous fauna disappeared and river valley soil became too saline to sustain agriculture. People started migrating from rural to urban areas. Ecological restoration of the basin became the government's utmost priority. In 1997, a local company, Bayamo Forest Company, was given this responsibility, which created the concept of 'Ecological Farm Forests' to restore the basin. Land was divided into plots and these plots ranging from 12 to 25 hectares were assigned to families to reforest and manage. These families were the employees of the company and they were given hold of the land for 30 years. They could fulfil their day to day needs from the land. They were given technical assistance, seedlings, fertilisers, tools, clothing and transportation. Comfortable houses were built for them. Families planted timber yielding trees, fruit trees, medicinal plants and raised livestock on the land. This has fulfilled their basic needs and area has been reforested. Approximately 1307 hectares, including 201 km of river bank, have been completely reforested. Soil erosion and land degradation have been considerably controlled.

With an area of 1.7 million hectares, this is one of the largest intact tropical rainforest in Central America. Uaxactun is an archaeological site in the reserve, where around 140 mixed and indigenous families live. These families subsist on non timber forest products (NTFP) such as edible fruits, gum resin and palm leaves. Government has provided concession to these families for 25 years to extract forest products against the concession fee. In order to manage and conserve the forest around Uaxactun, the organizacion de Manejo y Conservacion (OMYC) was formed. It is supported by the local branch of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), a US based conservation organisation. WCS helps OMYC in paying the concession fee for local people for the use of more than 84000 hectares of the forest. It also helps community to improve their forest based on NTFPs, ecotourism and a minimal use of timber as well as to conserve game species upon which they depend. A management plan with the help of community has been drawn, which clearly demarcates the areas for different use. Community members are allowed a selective harvest of timber from 162 hectares of demarcated area every year. The management plan has also identified critical habitats which must be preserved. Due to proper management density of three commercially important NTFP species Chicle, Xate palm and Allspice have increased. Chicle latex is used in chewing gum, Xate palm leaves are used for ornamental purposes and Allspice berries are used for culinary and pickling spice. These products are sustainbly harvested and exported to the USA and European countries. It provides employment for over 7000 people in Peten and generates an annual income of approximately US $ 47 million. It has led to an increase in income of many families up to two times previous earnings. Simultaneously, ecotourism has been promoted in the area. Five% of net earning from ecotourism goes to local people, which is invested in community projects such as a women's craft project and the local school.

This coffee is mainly shade grown in the forests, which are owned by small landowners or communities. These communities slash the vegetation and set fire to it for the fertilising effect. But the fires have led to the unintentional destruction of prime forests throughout the region leading to soil erosion and habitat loss. The Union Ejidos la Selva, a local community association, has been working with over 1300 families in Chiapas for the past 20 years to grow organic coffee in an ecologically sustainable manner. The Union represents growers and millers who produce coffee. Agronomists from the Union train farmers in organic techniques to increase the quantity and quality of the coffee. They have trained farmers in terrace sloping, pruning, intercropping and establishing the nurseries. Another community organisation, Vinculo y Desarrollo, works with the Union and promotes alternative business models with marginalised social groups in rural and urban areas of Chiapas. They help to market the coffee by promoting the brand and the cultural values associated with the indigenous communities that grow the coffee. The two organisations jointly run a coffee chain known as Café de la Selva, which has 18 outlets in Mexico, Europe and USA. Coffee producers are given a fair price. With good incomes, the nutrition and education level of the community children have improved. Thanks to intercropping, farmers get firewood, medicinal plants, fruits and herbs as additional benefits, which have improved local livelihoods.

These forest reserves have been exploited by large external corporations, which exploit them for timber and from small-scale farmers called campesinos, which practice slash and burn. To protect the forests, in 1991, Nicaragua Government declared a 7500 sq km area of the Atlantic coast's indigenous territory as a national reserve, which was later recognised as Bosawas Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. However, despite the protection, illegal logging and population incursions in to the Bosawas continued. Campesions kept pushing further into reserve to find new lands for agriculture as old lands became unproductive. However, impacts of large-scale degradation became apparent and Campesinos thought of improving their agricultural practices. In 1992, with the help of the National Union of Farmers and Ranchers (UNAG), they started Campesino to Campesino Programme (PCaC) in Nicaragua's Siuna municipality. Through a field visit in the neighbouring region, they learnt about the use of leguminous plants to retain the fertility of the land for a long time. Farmers started experimenting to meet the challenges of loss of soil fertility, abandoning field burning, conserving areas for forest regeneration and diversifying the production. They started intercropping corn, rice and other leguminous crops like pigeon pea in the same plot. Natural insecticides were made from chill peppers, garlic, onion, tobacco and other local resources as a substitute for expensive chemical products. These techniques became successful and, over the years, 80 families adopted these and most of them rotate up to 10 different crops on their land. Average yield has gone up from 974 kilos to 2600 kilos per hectare. Intercropping has provided them a mix of products and food security has increased. Now hundreds of framers are exchanging ideas and experimenting in groups. Experienced farmers have trained 3000 families, which are further experimenting, and training other farmers. Farmers have become aware about the importance of forest and biodiversity. 300 farmers have put aside between 3.5 and 14 hectares of protected forest patch. Thousands of trees have been planted along regeneration corridors that link their land to the biosphere reserve. Over the last ten years PCaC has grown into a movement.

In 1996, Rainforest expeditions, an independent travel company, formed a partnership with the community to start a 30-bed ecotourism lodge, Posada Amazonas. When the lodge was constructed, community provided free unskilled labour and sold the project local materials, such as cane and palm leaves. Community took a loan to pay for the imported construction material. The lodge was built as a site for wildlife viewing of rare species like giant river otters, harpy eagles and Macaws. However, efforts are made not to disturb the wild animals. To avoid disturbance to Otters, commercial fishing is not allowed in the lake and rafts are used to take tourist to viewing points rather than motorboats. Community is also involved in wild life research and monitoring projects. The lodge has generated additional jobs. 60% of the total income goes to the community. Community is using the additional income for community development projects. In 2000, 25% of the profits were used to build the only school of the region.

However, it has a tropical forest ecosystems and is rich in biodiversity with many species of rare flora and fauna. It has a population of 35000. People depended on the cultivation of a single crop of cocoa. In 1979, a fungal disease virtually collapsed the local agricultural economy. It forced farmers to clear the land to raise cattle, cut the trees for timber, and introduce intensive farming methods to produce short cycle cash crops. It created havoc on the local forest ecosystem. In the year 1983, a local NGO, Asociacion ANAI, and later two other organisations, launched an Initiative to stop these practices and assist people in finding alternative livelihoods. ANAI realised that there were hardly any community groups, which could come together and solve common problems. ANAI organised people over a period of three years, which led to the formation of community organisations, like the Association of Small Producers of Talamanca (APPTA), the Talamanca Caribbean Biological Corridor (CBTC), Finca Educativa, a regional training centre; and the community savings and loan groups. In 1985, Initiative helped in the establishment of Gandoca-Manzanillo National Wildlife refuge for the protection of endangered Manatee. Experiments to establish diversified agro forestry system, where different species of fruits, nuts and spice crops could be grown together in a single plot, were started. Soon these experiments became successful and ANAI helped farmers establish tree nurseries in different communities. Between 1985 and 1990, more than 2 million cash crops, food crops and trees for timber were planted on the region's family farms, creating a much diverse resource base. APPTA developed processing infrastructure for local products and marketing strategies. It identified markets for organic products and established the first organic certification programme of Costa Rica. This strategy became commercially so successful that 1000 farmers have established organic agro ecosystems. APPTA has become the largest producer and exporter of organic products in Central America, generating an annual income of US $ 500000 to date, which are channelled to local economy. Finca Educativa trains over 2000 people every year in agriculture, health and appropriate technologies. In the year 1998, 17 different associations and businesses formed a network to promote ecotourism in the area. Now there are five ecotourism lodges, which are all owned and managed by community organisations. It has spurred small local businesses. Community's income has increased six times.

It had competing pressures from the communities, whose livelihoods involved harvesting timber and forest products and from immigrant farmers, who wanted to clear the land for agriculture and grazing. In 1979, UNESCO designated this area as of international importance for its outstanding biodiversity. This declaration led to social conflicts because of the ban on its indiscriminate use. As a consequence, communities of Peten formed the Association of Forest Communities in Peten (ACOFOP), an umbrella organisation to search for solutions through sharing rights and responsibilities between users and state through forest concessions. Earlier these concessions were accorded to timber companies. This gave communities rights in the management and use of the reserve. ACOFOP brought together 19 local community based organisations, representing 30 rural communities and around 2000 families. Management plans were created based on a minimum rotation period of 25 years. Areas with an average of one tree per hectare were demarcated for timber extraction. All area was used for extraction of non-timber forest products. This stopped uncontrolled migration and conversion of forests to agriculture and pasturelands. Forest fires, which were mostly caused by human, are also controlled. Social conflicts over resource use are also greatly reduced. Forest Stewardship Council certified 214 448 hectares of forest area for its sustainable use, which made it the largest certified forest under community management in the world. Some communities have started exporting certified timber. Communities have been trained in community based ecotourism and production and commercialisation of medicinal plants and handicrafts, which have provided communities new opportunities for income generation. This initiative has generated 40000 days of waged work per year. The minimum salary in these communities has gone up to US$ 7-10 per day as compared to national average of US $4 per day. Finally, work of ACOFOP has reduced poverty, limited deforestation and has initiated a sustainable use of the local forests.","Uncontrolled migration and conversion of forests to agriculture and pasturelands have stopped.

It has wetlands, lagoons, mangroves and the world's second largest coral reef. It is home to four indigenous groups - the Miskito, Tawahka, Pesch and Garifuna. These groups make their living by subsistence agriculture, fishing, hunting and gathering from the forest and occasional wage labour. However, their resource base is under threat from unsustainable practices like large-scale cattle ranching, logging operations and petroleum and mineral exploration. A local NGO, Mosquitia Pawisa Agency for the Development of the Honduras Mosquitia (MOPAWI) has been working with the community groups to ensure the ecological sustainability and improve livelihoods for the last fifteen years. The agency facilitates the co-development of people and the resources with local participation. In the Mocorn zone, MOPAWI has supported and trained communities in the use of 68000 hectares of forestland allocated to them by the government. It helped people prepare a management plan for 3500 hectares of pine forest and 14500 hectares of broadleaved forest. Likewise, it supports more than 100 people in a protection programme for marine turtles. These people patrol beach, protect and monitor the nests until the baby turtles are born. So far, 5967 baby turtles are born and set free in sea. MOPAWA supports a butterfly farm, which is used to export butterflies to zoos and museums in USA. It runs environmental education programmes on the three biosphere reserves of the region. Simultaneously, MOPAWA has promoted sustainable agriculture and agro forestry practices for improving the livelihoods. These activities involve 700 families in 48 communities. These communities are provided with technical assistance on agro industrial crops, plantains and bananas, basic grains and family garden plots. These activities have improved food security and improved nutrition through cultivation of vegetables. The cultivation of organic cocoa constitutes the only source of income for 600 families.

This programme was created in 1998 in partnership with Brazilian NGOs, private companies like Daimler Chrysler and international organisations, like United Nations Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It is currently active in Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia and is expanding to Peru and Venezuela. It works with the forest communities and assist them from production till marketing. Communities have started processing and marketing products like Acai beverage, banana flour, coconut fibres and latex pots. Acai beverage is made from fruit pulp of Acai palm and is extremely nutritious energy drink. This palm was being exploited unsustainably and was under threat. Seventeen Brazilian communities have formed a producers association, set up a processing plant and have started producing Acai beverage. Banana flour is made out of dehydrated green bananas and is used in porridge, milkshakes and cakes etc. Bananas are cultivated in agro forestry systems, enabling the recovery of degraded land through reforestation and soil protection. More than 16 communities are involved in cultivation and processing of bananas. Likewise, coconut fibres are used as a substitute for Xaxim, an endangered species of orchid, to produce pots for plants. Earlier coconut husk was discarded and burnt. But now more than 5000 families of the region are organised in producer associations and seven agro industries. They sell the products directly to Poematec industry, a partnership between POEMA, the Brazilian programme on poverty and environment and the motor company DaimlerChrysler. Under the Amazon paper project, there are efforts to provide alternatives to wood based paper. The communities are cultivating a local plant Curaua as an alternative to the wood. Paper production is done in sustainable manner and income goes to local communities. The programme has established a marketing information system known as SIMBA, which links small scale producers and buyers. So far, there are 350 products, 100 buyers and 100 producers registered on this system. All products are marketed under fair trade, organic and natural banners to create a special niche. This has made the sale of the products quite easy and has returned handsome profits to the producers. Local employment has increased as producers are being integrated into large production chains and trade is increasingly on equitable basis. Conservation of tropical forests is being encouraged through a combination of agro forestry systems, natural resource management and the development of sustainable productive chains.","The use of coconut fibres for making plant pots has reduced pressure on Xaxim, an endangered species of orchid.

But slowly, WWF staff started raising awareness about the issue and importance of sustainable forest management in the local communities and the multinational companies working in the area. WWF trained company's staff in using the appropriate technologies like GPS satellite cyber tracking for their logging operations. They were informed about ecologically sensitive areas and corridors used by animals such as elephants and great apes. This technology was also used to track wildlife. Management plans were prepared for the logging areas. Each logging concession was divided into 2.5 sq. km plots where loggers could harvest timber from one plot every year.

Park is home to animals like Indian Rhinoceros, tigers and several species of deer. Around the park, there are about 275000 people living in 36 villages. They depend on the park for firewood, fodder and other basic needs. In the past, there were regular conflicts between park management and local people. Three to five people were killed every year by rhinos and tigers. Domestic cattle constituted up to 30% of total tigers killed and rhinos and other wild animals damaged the crops. So there was a tense relation between local people and the park. However, in 1993 through a pioneering legislation, areas surrounding the park were declared buffer zone where people could manage the forests and 30 to 50 percent of park revenues could be used by the local user group committees. One of the local groups, Baghamara group built nature trails for elephant back safaris and a wildlife viewing tower, where tourists could stay overnight to view wildlife. Within the first six months, nearly 8000 visitors visited the Baghmara wild life viewing area generating nearly US $ 200,000 in revenues. This provided enough money to the group to refurbish their three schools and a health clinic. The area which in the past was degraded is now one of the most popular tourist attractions of Nepal.

A community development department and an extension agency were set up to support local people's interets in the management of the conservation area. The protected area was promoted as a multiple use area, where domestic livestock and wildlife could thrive together. In addition, people were provided with subsidized grains, which contributed to improve food security, veterinary services were provided and water resources were developed.

It is rich in biodiversity with hundreds of endemic birds and rich flora. Over the years population growth, land clearing for coffee, livestock production and conversion of forests in to pastures, have reduced the forest to 7% of its original area. Desengano State Park is one of the largest remaining parts of Atlantic forest in Brazil. It is located in the state of Rio de Janerio, where dairy farming is one of the most important economic activities. In the past, due to low productivity of dairy farming, farmers had to keep large herds, which in turn needed bigger areas of pasture. This was posing a serious threat to the remaining forest area. In early 1990s, an NGO called Pro-Natura started working with the dairy farmers to protect the forest. The organisation made a deal with the dairy farmers that it would provide them technical assistance to improve dairy farm productivity and incomes and in return farmers would have to regenerate and reforest their lands. It assisted farmers to invest in genetic improvement of their dairy herds, use mineral supplements, improve fodder and produce silage. This tripled the milk yield and incomes increased by more than 100%. With the improvement of cattle breed and fodder quality, small pastures became sufficient reducing the pressure on forest. More than 60 ha of pasture could be converted back to forests. Nurseries were established to distribute free seedlings to the farmers for reforestation of their private lands.

It was started by a group of local NGOs and farmers to tap the growing organic products’ market. OPPAZ started its agriculture extension work in three selected project areas of Mazabuka, Mpongwe and Kabwe. These areas were characteristically commercial farm blocks with fertile soil, relatively good rainfall and infrastructure. It targeted both small scale and large commercial farmers for increasing awareness about the organic agriculture and trained them in growing targeted crop species in organic ways. It included training on techniques like green manuring, crop rotation, pot holing, fertility beds and inter cropping systems. Demonstration plots using various techniques were set up for learning and replication with the help of Golden Valley Agriculture Research Trust (GART). Organic certification was organised twice a year through two major European accredited certification bodies for individual producers and small-scale grower cooperatives. It provided the producers an access to European markets. Links with national and international traders like Zambia Export Growers Association (ZEGA) and TRAIDCRAFT were established to market the products. OPPAZ also promoted harvesting and marketing of valuable wild plant products like Marula, Manketti, Baobab, Kigelia Africana, speciality mushrooms, citronella and lemon grass. Within a few years, membership of OPPAZ has increased to 3500 certified organic producers with an area of around 1500 sq km under organic agriculture.

It is also the world’s 13th poorest country, which puts enormous pressure on its natural resources. Due to increasing population, more and more people are migrating and settling in forests. Farmers practice slash and burn type of agriculture. There is widespread poverty and food insecurity in the country. Lack of transparent governance in the area of natural resource management has made the situation worse. Since 1990, USAID has been working with the Government of Madagascar (GOM) on environmental and rural development issues and is a lead donor of the Madagascar National Environment Action Plan (NEAP). USAID initiated a dialogue with the GOM to improve governance in fishing, logging and mining. It became a trigger for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Programme. The GOM created a new, semi autonomous observatory to enhance improved governance and transparent natural resource management. It established a public-private sector forum to integrate the environmental dimensions into planning for rural development, food security and poverty alleviation. Decentaralised rural development and environmental planning has enhanced the role of rural communities. Under USAID programmes, 380 villages in priority zones are now participating in community-based conservation. These villages have formed Producer Organisations (PO) and have abandoned slash and burn agriculture. Now there are 144 POs with 2275 farmers as their members, which have adopted improved agricultural practices. This has resulted in an increase in the rice yields by 100% and 120% in off-season crops, like potatoes and beans. These POs have been linked to private businesses in ecotourism, beekeeping and fish farming. 26 POs are selling fruits, essential oils, spices, and field crops through agribusinesses, which has resulted in increase in their incomes. In the southern region of the country, USAID has set up an Ecotourism Investment Zone (EIZ) to promote investment in ecotourism.

It was founded in response to a study, which revealed that in four district of Zimbabwe, farmers suffered severe shortage of seeds due to pests and droughts, which led to food insecurity. In 1996, SALRED initiated formation of community seed centres in four villages of Mutoko district to relieve chronic shortage of seed supply. It was based on the traditional concept of seed storage.  Local farmers provided labour and locally available material while SALRED assisted with the money for other building material. All four communities elected management committees to oversee the management of seed centres.  Diifferent local varieties of seeds of different crops were identified and stored communally. Farmers were trained in seed production, selection and storage. Every member was supposed to contribute 60 kg of one of their best varieties of seed to the centre. A member who failed to do so was fined. Then a mix of different varieties was given back to members. New crops like cassava and jutrofa were introduced and diverse cropping was promoted. A production team was established to organise field shows, seed fairs and to set dates for harvesting of seed, supervise seed production grading, treatment and storage. It was also responsible for sale of any surplus seed. SALRED organised training for farmers in leadership and small-scale business management. These activities have led to a marked increase in diversity in the area.

At the same time, the country is located in the ecological 'buffer zone' of the Sahel. Its remaining dry forest resources are themselves threatened by massive degradation.<BR>After a traditional forestry policy had been pursued for a long time in the Gambia, which placed the state at the centre of forest management and conservation, and left the population on the sidelines, a \"paradigm shift\" took place in the late eighties. It had become apparent that the state alone could not solve the structural problems of forest destruction, and that without a fundamental change of policy it would not be possible to significantly influence degradation of the ecological resource base in rural areas. Proceeding from the fact that, according to the traditional legal system, the villages possess a mandate to manage and utilise the natural resources in their respective area, it was planned to strengthen their vested interest in actively conserving the resource, and their access to its economic benefits. This was to be achieved through the instrument of an unlimited-term transfer of forest ownership guaranteed by the state.<BR>The Technical Cooperation project \"Promotion of the Gambian Forest Service\", promoted by German Bilateral Development Cooperation, had been part of this change process since 1980, and initially had helped shape it as forest project on the ground. The positive experiences gained in activities to directly transfer management responsibility to the population ultimately led to \"community forest management\" becoming a pillar of the new forest policy strategy in the Gambia. This step was accompanied by comprehensive changes in the legal and institutional environments.<BR>In 1991, the first management agreement between a village and the forest administration was concluded. Over 450 villages are now involved, with approx. 16,000 ha of forest land. The national quantitative target is to bring 200,000 ha under management by the rural population, a significant area in relatively small Gambia. The ecological and poverty-reducing potential of participatory forest management that goes beyond isolated solutions, and involves the population not just on a one-off basis, now becomes clearly evident. The beneficiaries of the structural changes generated are the rural population.","Around 16,000 ha of forest land have been brought under management or protection measures via the instrument of \"management agreements with communities\". The key management instrument is fire protection and the incidence and extent of fires overall has diminished significantly. The instrument of fire protection also forms an important instrument of forest rehabilitation, by harnessing the natural regeneration potential of the dry forest.","450 villages are now involved in community forest management. The reduction in fire-induced losses achieved allows better macroeconomic utilisation of the productivity and potential value added of existing forest resources. For the first time, forest management is gaining monetary value for the rural population as a land-use form, and can thus compete with other land-use forms. Community forest management has also stimulated the development of new sources of income in immediately adjacent sectors, e.g. the emergence of private nurseries. The rural population have gained fresh scope for action to effectively assert vis-à-vis third parties their interests and claims concerning the utilisation and control of natural resources. As management competence has been transferred to local communities, a diversification of management institutions has been set in motion. This process is harnessing productively the organisation and management potentials that exist within the population and developing them further.","LR|","http://www.undp.org/seed/pei/share/forest.html",,"http://www.wrm.org.uy/bulletin/60/Gambia.html<BR>ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/004/X6808E/<BR>http://www.crdfp.org/fd.htm#FM<BR>Friederike.v.

It has an area of 74,794 ha and a population of about 10,000 IlKisonko Maasai. A large portion of the ranch is arid with highly variable rainfall amounts ranging between 300 and 500 mm per year. Vegetation resources are scanty, being retarded by overgrazing and the harsh physical conditions. Although Eselenkei Group Ranch supports a large number of Maasai livestock, it is a dispersal area for wildlife of the Amboseli Biosphere Reserve. Crop–wildlife interaction is generating new dimensions of conflicts. Stray wildlife trample on crops leading to them being killed by angry farmers. All these factors have led to Eselenkei Group Ranch lagging behind in terms of national development. <BR>In May 1997, the Group Ranch Committee entered into a lease agreement for 16 ha of the Eselenkei Conservation Area (ECA) with a private developer for the Porini Ecotourism Project (PEP). The objective of PEP is to promote low tourism and wildlife conservation, and generate income and economic benefits for the community to avoid dependence on pastoralism alone and, reduce wildlife-related conflicts. Since its inception, PEP has contributed to local livelihood and natural resource management.","Ecotourism initiatives have made little positive impact on natural resource management compared to poverty alleviation. However, there is evidence that overall the numbers of wildlife (including charismatic species) in the area have either remained stable or increased (e.g. resident giraffes, bird species and bush-loving wildlife have more than doubled following the increase in biomass and antipoaching campaigns spearheaded by community scouts). Through exposure tours and consultative meetings, the community has been sensitized to the need to reduce livestock numbers. Formerly degraded sites around community watering points are regenerating.","Porini Ecotourism pays a fee of US$5,300 per year with a 10% increment for the lease of 16 ha of land. In addition, the community receives amounts ranging between US$500 and 1,200 per year as gate fees and bed charges paid by tourists. The Group Ranch Committee uses these earnings to support different community livelihood initiatives, such as the construction of schools, payment  of hospital bills and maintenance of boreholes. Individual households benefit from the sale of firewood and charcoal, and from the salaries Porini pays to 26 members of staff drawn from the Eselenkei community. Earnings received from ecotourism are used in various ways, including purchase of livestock drugs and steers, initiatives that are contributing towards livelihood in general and local food security in specific. Finally, in recognition of the community’s willingness to share grazing resources with roaming wildlife, the Kenya Wildlife Service contributes US$12,500 annually.

Unlike the Park, the ‘Zona Reservada’ designation confers only limited protection.","Madre de Dios, and the Tambopata region in particular, have long been known to tropical biologists as a region high in species diversity, containing some of the world’s highest recorded alpha-diversities of plants, insects, birds and mammals, as well as some of the world’s largest expanses of pristine tropical forest, including Manu National Park. In 1990, Perú established the 1.5 million ha Zona Reservada Tambopata-Candamo. Unlike the Park, the ‘Zona Reservada’ designation confers only limited protection and, thus, the ZRTC has been colonized, mainly along the river.<BR>Explorer’s Inn lodge on the Tambopata River was founded in 1976. The Peruvian government granted Explorer’s Inn a 5500 ha reserve; this was the confusingly-named Zona Reservada Tambopata. The trail system and buildings, which were paid for by tourism, aided research in tropical ecology. It was subsequently discovered that the Explorer’s Inn’s reserve overlapped almost completely with land which had been previously and permanently assigned to the neighbouring Ese’eja Comunidad Indigena of Infierno. To reduce this conflict, Explorer’s Inn agreed to pay Infierno US$ 1 for each tourist, to provide employment for some members of the community and to fund a cooperative ethnobotanical study. In return, Infierno would respect the boundaries of the reserve and forego hunting macaws on a clay lick located downstream from the lodge.<BR>Initially, the standard model of ecotourism was realized in Tambopata: tourism generated the revenues that employed locals and paid for the maintenance and preservation of the reserves, thereby providing the direct link between habitat conservation and local incomes. However, during the 1980s Explorer’s Inn failed in its pledge to pay the Comunidad of Infierno for each tourist, in part due to a three-year crash in tourism which put the lodge’s very survival at stake. As a result, relations soured between the Comunidad of Infierno and Explorer’s Inn. In 1993, Infierno reclaimed its land and hired a surveyor to demarcate boundaries, leaving Explorer’s Inn with only 15 of its original 5,500 ha. The Comunidad of Infierno’s plans include farming and hunting, as well as timber and Brazil nut extraction.<BR>The failure of the lodge to protect its reserves was probably inevitable given the land tenure laws prevalent in Perú’s Amazonian regions prior to 1994, which didn't grant rights over land. Reforms in the Peruvian land laws since 1994 now make it possible to buy rainforest from the State, turning public lands into private property.","Initially, tourism generated the revenues that paid for the maintenance and preservation of the reserves.

Because there was no legal structure to buy land in Amazonian Perú during this era, the original investor, Raul Medina, applied under his own name for a certificado de poseción to a plot of land. These certificados de poseción give holders the right to hunt, log, and farm a 30 ha plot of land, but no right of ownership. Peruvian Andean Treks subsequently became a partner with Medina and ended up becoming the majority partner. In 1991, construction of the newly-named Tambopata Jungle Lodge (TJL) began. Subsequently, two more pieces of land were acquired. One piece was granted to TJL (25 ha) as a reserve, similar to those of Explorer?s Inn and Cuzco Amazónico Lodge (see case studies n°77 and 78). TJL received certificados de poseción on another two sites from 1993 to 1994, expanding total holdings from 85 ha to 215 ha, which included 1920 m of river frontage.<BR>In 1991, in part as a direct response to the declaration of the ZRTC, colonists began to claim concessions along the length of the Tambopata River. By 1993, colonists had flanked TJL. Hunting began within TJL?s concessions. In 1994, neighbouring colonists measured the north river frontage claimed by TJL and alleged that the lodge was claiming 200 m more river frontage than it actually had certificados for. At the same time, the neighbouring colonists formed a Comunidad Agricola of 250 inhabitants. Clearly, the behaviour of the neighbouring colonists was strategic and intended to take advantage of what they saw as an attractive economic opportunity. By attempting to take out certificados de poseción to disputed pieces of land within TJL?s concessions, colonists were attempting to extract payments similar to those which had been made to the original certificado holders.<BR>Fortunately, because the neighbouring colonists had organized themselves into a Comunidad, a negotiated settlement was logistically possible. In December of 1994, TJL promised to help build a school for the Comunidad. In exchange, the Comunidad signed a formal agreement to recognize TJL?s permanent claim to the 1020 m stretch of river frontage on the north bank, the 950 m stretch on the south bank, and also agreed to allow TJL to take out concessions along an additional 930 m of river frontage on the north bank. The Comunidad also promised to forego hunting, farming and the extraction of forest products on all of this land.<BR>In the same year, the legal environment changed drastically when the government of Perú made formal the process for granting title to land in its Amazonian regions. TJL immediately purchased from the State the 1020m of river frontage on the north bank of the river and the 950m along the south bank, paying the State the equivalent of US$ 7705 over five years at current exchange rates. In 1996, TJL paid colonists to transfer a total of 106 ha of concessions, at approximately US$ 40 per hectare.","Since the agreement has been signed, only one case of hunting has occurred, and the Comunidad has sanctioned the transgressor by threatening him with expulsion.","As of April 1997, TJL and the Comunidad had decided on a site for the school, designed the structure, agreed on the partition of labour and materials, and were applying for state aid, filing for the necessary governmental permits and conducting a census of school children.","PG|","Yu, D.W., Hendrickson, T., and Castillo, A., 1997, 'Ecotourism and Conservation in Amazonian Peru: Short-Term and Long-Term Challenges', Environmental Conservation 24(2): 130-38",,"http://www.tambopatalodge.com/",". ecotourism in amazonian perù 3 tambopata jungle lodge tjl peruvian andean treks tambopata region ecosystem landscape local community conserve biodiversity within the tjl s concessions help build a school; potentially provide employment for members of the comunidad in 1988 the cuzco based tour agency peruvian andean treks began to investigate the possibility of constructing a lodge on the tambopata river because there was no legal structure to buy land in amazonian perú during this era the original investor raul medina applied under his own name for a certificado de poseción to a plot of land these certificados de poseción give holders the right to hunt log and farm a 30 ha plot of land but no right of ownership peruvian andean treks subsequently became a partner with medina and ended up becoming the majority partner in 1991 construction of the newly named tambopata jungle lodge tjl began subsequently two more pieces of land were acquired one piece was granted to tjl 25 ha as a reserve similar to those of explorer?s inn and cuzco amazónico lodge see case studies n°77 and 78 tjl received certificados de poseción on another two sites from 1993 to 1994 expanding total holdings from 85 ha to 215 ha which included 1920 m of river frontage in 1991 in part as a direct response to the declaration of the zrtc colonists began to claim concessions along the length of the tambopata river by 1993 colonists had flanked tjl hunting began within tjl?s concessions in 1994 neighbouring colonists measured the north river frontage claimed by tjl and alleged that the lodge was claiming 200 m more river frontage than it actually had certificados for at the same time the neighbouring colonists formed a comunidad agricola of 250 inhabitants clearly the behaviour of the neighbouring colonists was strategic and intended to take advantage of what they saw as an attractive economic opportunity by attempting to take out certificados de poseción to disputed pieces of land within tjl?s concessions colonists were attempting to extract payments similar to those which had been made to the original certificado holders fortunately because the neighbouring colonists had organized themselves into a comunidad a negotiated settlement was logistically possible in december of 1994 tjl promised to help build a school for the comunidad in exchange the comunidad signed a formal agreement to recognize tjl?s permanent claim to the 1020 m stretch of river frontage on the north bank the 950 m stretch on the south bank and also agreed to allow tjl to take out concessions along an additional 930 m of river frontage on the north bank the comunidad also promised to forego hunting farming and the extraction of forest products on all of this land in the same year the legal environment changed drastically when the government of perú made formal the process for granting title to land in its amazonian regions tjl immediately purchased from the state the 1020m of river frontage on the north bank of the river and the 950m along the south bank paying the state the equivalent of us$ 7705 over five years at current exchange rates in 1996 tjl paid colonists to transfer a total of 106 ha of concessions at approximately us$ 40 per hectare since the agreement has been signed only one case of hunting has occurred and the comunidad has sanctioned the transgressor by threatening him with expulsion as of april 1997 tjl and the comunidad had decided on a site for the school designed the structure agreed on the partition of labour and materials and were applying for state aid filing for the necessary governmental permits and conducting a census of school children .",,,"C0078","Ecotourism in Amazonian Perù 2: Explorer's Inn"

Bwindi, Mgahinga and Kibale all protect mid-high elevation rain forest. Bwindi and Mgahinga are particularly rich in endemic species, and all three parks shelter endangered wildlife, particularly primates. All three sites were designated forest reserves by colonial authorities in 1931–1932, and were eventually surrounded by intensive agriculture, due partly to official resettlement schemes and refugees fleeing war in neighbouring countries. Settlement within the boundaries of the three reserves accelerated during the 1970s after President Idi Amin announced that Ugandans were free to settle on any unoccupied public land. As peace returned to the country in the late 1980s, the government began to enforce existing regulations regarding natural resource use. Then, in the early 1990s, under pressure from national and international conservationists, the Ugandan government ‘upgraded’ these three forest reserves to national parks. Along with this upgrade came stricter enforcement of existing regulations, implementation of new regulations, and increased conflict between local residents and protected areas.<BR>Residents neighbouring Bwindi Impenetrable National Park traditionally depended on the forest for firewood, timber, meat, and medicinal herbs. After Bwindi was gazetted a national park in 1991, hostility towards the protected area increased, due to the enforcement of stricter regulations restricting access to these forest resources. To decrease conflict with neighbouring communities, UWA (Uganda Wildlife Authority) and two international NGOs (International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) and Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE)) began implementing a number of programmes including tourism revenue-sharing, sustainable use of non-timber forest products(NTFPs), conservation education and problem-animal control. <BR>The mountain gorilla ecotourism programme in Bwindi began in 1993, and continues to grow. There are currently two groups of gorillas visited daily by tourists, and a third group is ready for tourism, awaiting UWA approval. Prices for gorilla tracking have been rising steadily, and tourists now pay US$ 250 to view the gorillas for one hour. TRS has funded community development projects in 19 of the 21 parishes bordering the Park since the programme began in 1995. Each parish received approximately US$ 4000 and all either focused on building primary schools, health clinics, or improving roads. <BR>Both IGCP and CARE provided the UWA staff responsible for implementing the TRS programme with strategic planning assistance as well as technical, logistical, and monetary support for community training. Although the TRS programme relied upon donor support in its initial stages, TRS was seen primarily as a UWA programme with the potential to offset these initial costs with long-term benefits. In addition to receiving tourism revenue, local residents are allowed to extract certain resources from Bwindi. Beekeepers in five parishes have been allowed to harvest honey from beehives within the Park. Eight other parishes are participating in programmes that allow the utilization of NTFPs such as fibrous plants for basketry and medicinal herbs from the Park.","TRS has played a major role in improving the attitudes of local residents towards the park, therefore reducing poaching and illegal harvesting.","Tourism revenue-sharing has funded community development projects in 19 of the 21 parishes bordering the Park since the programme began in 1995.

When Mgahinga was designated a Park in 1991, access to forest resources was restricted, although local residents were allowed to continue collecting water from inside the Park. In 1993, 2,420 farmers were evicted from land within the Park boundaries, compensated, and resettled elsewhere. These resource use prohibitions, and resettlement generated considerable local hostility. Cattle grazing inside the Park, as well as snaring of forest wildlife, are the primary threats to Mgahinga. UWA has implemented a suite of programmes in Mgahinga similar to those at Bwindi in order to decrease conflicts between the park and its neighbouring communities. <BR>Gorilla tracking in Mgahinga began in 1994, and tourists now pay US$ 175 to visit the one group of gorillas, which is habituated to tourists.

Bwindi, Mgahinga and Kibale all protect mid-high elevation rain forest. Bwindi and Mgahinga are particularly rich in endemic species, and all three parks shelter endangered wildlife, particularly primates. All three sites were designated forest reserves by colonial authorities in 1931–1932, and were eventually surrounded by intensive agriculture, due partly to official resettlement schemes and refugees fleeing war in neighbouring countries. Settlement within the boundaries of the three reserves accelerated during the 1970s after President Idi Amin announced that Ugandans were free to settle on any unoccupied public land. As peace returned to the country in the late 1980s, the government began to enforce existing regulations regarding natural resource use. Then, in the early 1990s, under pressure from national and international conservationists, the Ugandan government ‘upgraded’ these three forest reserves to national parks. Along with this upgrade came stricter enforcement of existing regulations, implementation of new regulations, and increased conflict between local residents and protected areas.<BR>Residents neighbouring Kibale National Park (KNP) do not face the acute land and fuelwood shortage of those at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. However, as the forest patches outside the Park boundaries have diminished, many citizens have become more reliant on the Park for fuelwood, construction materials and medicinal herbs. Kibale also stands apart from Mgahinga and Bwindi for its more severe problems with crop-raiding wildlife, including elephants. Most farmers on Kibale’s edge lose less than 5% of planted fields each season, but individuals residing at chronic elephant raiding sites may lose over half their crop in a night.<BR>Park-community relations are worst to the south near the Kibale Game Corridor. Here, thousands of individuals were forcibly evicted and resettled elsewhere when Kibale was ‘upgraded’ from a Forest Reserve to a National Park in 1993. An official source reports 30,000 households were evicted but other estimates range from 8,800 to over 170,000 individuals. At roughly the same time as the eviction, tourism activities were initiated formally at Kibale. Tourists now pay US$ 10 each for a guided forest walk that offers an opportunity, but no guarantee, to see chimpanzees. Because chimpanzees are more difficult to view and track, Kibale cannot levy the high fees that Mgahinga and Bwindi charge for mountain gorillas. As a result, the revenue-sharing programme around Kibale is more modest. UWA has shared an average of US$ 800 in materials towards constructing schools in five parishes around KNP. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) provided monetary assistance for meetings and workshops as well as some technical assistance for the TRS programme; however, TRS played only a minor role in the project. Beyond revenue-sharing, IUCN has initiated projects allowing communities in nine parishes to use non-timber forest products in the Park, including wild coffee, medicinal plants, fish, beekeeping sites, poles and elephant grass.","TRS has played a major role in improving the attitudes of local residents towards the park, therefore reducing poaching and illegal harvesting.","UWA has shared an average of US$ 800 in materials towards constructing schools in five parishes around KNP.

The main conservation goal of the Refuge is to protect eight species of nesting marine turtles, particualry olive ridleys. Within the Refuge, an 800 m stretch of beach acts as an olive ridley 'arribada' (arrival in Spanish) beach. During arribada, olive ridleys congregate for mass nesting. Arribadas at Ostional occur more or less monthly, with some months missed during the dry season, and with sometimes more than one arribada per month during the wet season. While mass nesting are designed to swamp predators and increase the chances of individual survive, the density and frequency of nesting events in Ostional is so high it undermines the overall productivity. The evidence of low hatchling success rates at Ostional was a key argument in favour of a legalized harvest.<BR>The population of Ostional (approximately amounting to 390 people) has collected turtle eggs, which are considered a source of protein and an aphrodisiac, for a very long time. Efforts to prohibit egg harvesting at Ostional in order to conserve the turtles were made in the 1970s, however, the extreme poverty and the inadequacy of law enforcement made these attempts ineffective, and only promoted illegal harvesting. Most local people soon became unhappy with illegal harvest, a chaotic activity which saw individuals struggling to get the most eggs in the shortest time possible, and which resulted in an unequal distribution of benefits. Thus, in 1981, a small group of residents formed a committee determined to legalize egg harvest. In 1983, Law 6919 allowed for a limited, commercial sale of animal products from the Refuge, provided that: a) scientific studies justfied use; b) community members formed a legal development association. Soon after that, the 'Integrated Development Association of Ostional' was formed. The Association is in charge of the day to day running of the Ostional Egg Harvest project.<BR>Under the legal harvest, approximately 20-30% of the eggs laid are harvested in the dry season, and 3-15% in the wet season, much less than the number of eggs harvested before legalization. Once harvested, eggs are packaged on the beach, and clearly labelled, since another objective of the project is to undermine the black market for turtle eggs at the national level. Eggs are then distributed nationally by the Association. <BR>As part of the project, associates undertake activities to help ensure the long-term presence of the turtles (e.g. collection of garbage from the beach, escort hatchlings to the surf, discourage illegal harvesting, etc.) Profits from egg harvesting are divided as follows. Firstly, 40% of profits are paid to the government (INCOPESCA). 30% of the remaining profits are used to cover Association operating-expenses and to finance community projects. All associates are paid equally for hours worked on the beach from the remaining profits. Project profits are also used to purchase food for the health and nutrition centre, which provides hot lunches for school-age children, and the Association paid for the extension of electricity to Ostional in 1993.","The project contributed directly to wildlife conservation through both paid and voluntary conservation activities.

Declared in 1983, it was established to protect nesting sea turtles, particularly olive ridleys. Ostional village is also home to a small human population of approximately 390 people organized in 84 households. The primary economic activity in Ostional is participation in the legalized egg-harvesting project (see case study n°85), which provides a significant income for 70% of the households in Ostional. <BR>Even though Ostional is difficult to get to (particulalrly during the rainy and high nesting season for olive ridleys), and even though there is little else to see in Ostional apart from the turtles, it nevertheless receives both domestic and international tourists. Current tourism services in Ostional are limited to three sets of 'cabinas' (privately owned), for a total capacity of approximately 30 guests. Other services in town include a café, a bar, three small groceries stores (all owned by local families), and two restaurants opened by foreigners. <BR>To date, attempts to organize tourism in Ostional have been undertaken by the Ostional Development Association, while institutional involvement has been minimal. The government agency responsible for planning, the Instituto Costarricense de Turismo (Costa Rican Tourism Institute, or ICT), evaluated the area's potential in 1980, declared it non-touristic and has played no role in its development, apart from beginning to collect taxes from accommodation owners in 1995. The government agency responsible for the Ostional Wildlife Refuge, the Direction de Vida Silvestre (Wildlife Directorate, or DVS), has also played a minimal role in Ostional. As of 1995, a DVS ranger has been stationed in Ostional to collect an entry fee from tourists visiting the Refuge.<BR>The Ostional Development Association has attempted to increase the benefits of tourism to the community. In 1995, the association lobbied the federal government to purchase land surrounding the refuge, or expand its boundaries, in order to create a buffer zone against foreign tourism development. The government's response, however, was simple: there are no funds to buy the land and the community should purchase it itself. In 1996, a Dutch nongovernmental organization was considering granting $250,000 to the Ostional Development Association, to spend on training and capacity building for work in tourism and on the construction of association-owned cabinas. This organization eventually deemed the administrative capabilities of the association to be insufficient and the project was cancelled.","Ecotourism has a potentially negative impact on the nesting of olive ridleys turtles, due to artificial lightings, cameras, and general human disturbance.

It encompasses a wide variety of wildlife habitats, including open grasslands, acacia and miombo woodlands and riverine forests. The reserve contains some of the largest and most important populations of elephants, buffalos and wild dogs in Africa. About 60% of Tanzania's elephants are found there. With its extensive area of miombo forests, the Selous is one of the largest forest areas under protection.<BR>The processes of population resettlement and expansion of the protected area have shaped the long history of wildlife-human conflict in the villages bordering the SGR. The evolution of the SGR was also accompanied by the enactment of increasingly restrictive legislation regulating access to wildlife, which culminated in the passing of the 1974 Wildlife Conservation Act prohibiting human settlement in game reserves and limiting all hunting of wildlife to that licensed by the wildlife authority. In rural areas farming of food and cash crops is a major occupation for the majority of the villages, however the yields barely suffice their requirement. Specifically meat protein is in high demand because livestock keeping in the ecosystem of SGR is hardly possible due to Tsetse flies and is not a tradition. Therefore the villagers are dependent on game meat, even if it means breaking the law. Since the colonial time villagers had no legal access to game meat because they could not comply with the legal hunting regulations. In addition villagers living in areas bordering the reserve did not benefit from its resources but instead faced infrastructural disadvantages, suffered from crop damages and dangerous wild animals causing threats to human life. This applies to all protected areas in Tanzania. This led to antagonism towards the reserve and conflict between wildlife authorities and villagers and led to villagers poaching or tolerating poaching. The consequence of this was that commercial poaching increased in the 1980’s to a magnitude that endangered the further existence of the reserve. The elephant population had been reduced from more than initial 100.000 to below 30.000. The black rhinos almost became extinct.<BR>In 1988, in response to wildlife losses, the Selous Conservation Programme (SCP) was started. The plan aimed to secure better definition of boundaries, imposition of controls over poaching, logging and wildfires, and sustainable use of the wild resources. Most useful of all, to reduce the levels of poaching within the Reserve, and to create a buffer zone between it and the villages, communal wildlife management (CWM) schemes were established in wildlife management areas adjacent to 41 villages as part of a conservation program. By these, villagers agree to allow wildlife onto part of their lands in return for a sustainable hunting quota. These have been accompanied by self-help and rural development schemes to improve village services. As part of this program, the Reserve authorities retain 50% of the money made from tourist hunting to finance management.","When the SCP was started in 1988, poaching in the SGR, particularly for elephant and rhino, had reached disastrous levels. By 1991, elephant poaching in SGR had been virutally halted. The 1991 and 1994 animal census for the SGR showed an increase in some species, including elephants. The SCP, in particular access to quota meat, also had a significant positive influence on villagers' perceptions of the benefits of conserving wildlife.","The Selous Conservation Programme supplied game meat to the villagers, assistance for village development projects, and helped with the protection and management of wildlife on village lands.

This has been acknowledged by the government, which released a report in 1999, \"if current trends of overfishing and environmental degradation continue, coastal resources will not be able to provide enough food for the Philippines' growing population.\" The same report identifies coastal resource management (CRM) as a strategy for food security, and family planning as a \"strategic intervention\" to reduce fishing effort and population pressures in the coastal zone. In an effort to implement these recommended strategies and contribute to the evolving field of experience in integrated population-development, PFPI, a Filipino non-profit, non-governmental organization, is spearheading the Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (I-POPCORM) Initiative, with support from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and other contributors.<BR>I-POPCORM, addresses population, poverty and environment dynamics, and their linkages, in the Philippines coastal zone, where 60% of the Philippines population reside, and where poverty incidence and population growth/density exceed average national figures.

The project was designed as an Integrated Conservation and Development Project (ICDP) with the goal to conserve forest bio-diversity by promoting sustainable economic exploitation of non-timber forest products (NTFP) at community and provincial levels. As an ICDP, the NTFP Project also had a vested interest in supporting livelihoods and community development.<BR>The NTFP Project was first implemented in Nam Pheng, a village in Oudomxay province. When the NTFP Project first arrived to Nam Pheng in 1996, the village contained 43 households with 244 people. Households cultivated an average of one hectare per year and most households also raised livestock. The nearest school was in the neighbouring village of Na Hom, but attendance was reported to be low. Water for drinking and residential use came mostly from a stream passing through the village. Illnesses, especially diarrhoea and malaria, were prevalent. Villagers’ main source of cash income was NTFPs, although they were mostly collected and bartered on a small scale.<BR>The sustainable harvesting regimes supported by the NTFP Project began by organizing a rice bank. The rice bank addressed the villagers’ most pressing need, food security. It was indirectly related to NTFP conservation because it built trust among villagers in a conservation project, freed up their time for conservation activities, and reduced threats of over-harvesting in forests. After the rice bank, the project began on forestland allocation, domestication trials and NTFP marketing. Now households sell their stock directly to Group Committee, which in turn sells on a larger scale to traders. Generally, the individual collector takes 85-90% of the final sale, while the remaining 10-15% is put towards an NTFP Fund. The NTFP Fund is used to fund community projects (e.g., purchase of an electric generator), community services (e.g., provide loans), and pay salaries of 100 000 Kip to the monitoring, accounting and trade units. In 1999, the fund was used to improve the village’s water supply system and, in 2000, it supported the construction of a school, with financial assistance from the NTFP Project, and provided loans to fifteen households.<BR>Between 1996, when the NTFP Project first arrived to Nam Pheng village, and 2002, considerable advancements have been made in reducing poverty and improving livelihoods. Poverty rates reduced by at least one half. Food security increased; child mortality of children under 5 was eradicated; school enrolment doubled (over half of whom are girls); and savings increased, as shown through increases in livestock. The village acquired new infrastructure and new services, while villagers’ range of expenditures widened, improving quality of life and increasing production capacity. Although there were likely many different factors at work in making these achievements, NTFPs clearly played an important role. Currently, collection of bitter bamboo, cardamom and other NTFPs continue to be the main sources of income for the majority of households in Nam Pheng. In turn, the economic values of NTFPs have provided incentives for villagers to manage forests sustainably, including the 515 ha they have allocated as bamboo forest.","The economic values of NTFPs have provided incentives for villagers to manage forests sustainably, including the 515 ha they have allocated as bamboo forest.<BR>One of the most significant impact on forests was the reduction of upland cultivation by one third.","Between 1996 and 2002: poverty rates reduced by at least one half; food security increased; child mortality of children under 5 was eradicated; school enrolment doubled (over half of whom are girls); and savings increased, as shown through increases in livestock.

Most of the dense provincial population live of agropastoral economy, cotton being the only cash crop grown locally. The expansion of the cotton frontline towards natural reserves is viewed by many ecologists as a serious threat to biological conservation. However, cotton revenues per hectare amount to approximately 200 times more than revenues from wildlife, which explains why cotton production is so attractive to the local population. <BR>The majority of hunting zones are contracted out to expatriate professional hunters, whilst hunting rights are constrained by the level of species protection. The lease contract reccomends that, to the extent possible, professional hunters provide local communities with social amenities (schools and clinics) and preference in job offerings. Further, at the discretion of the hunter, inhabitants of hunting zones are entitled to usufruct rights over natural resources, except for wildlife, fish and minerals.<BR>Revenues from wildlife harvesting are shared between the public treasury (70%) and a special fund for the development of protected areas (30%), leaving out local communities.

Activities in KD1 involve both consuptive and non-consumptive use of natural resources.<BR>The advent of CBNRM in KD1 introduced a completely new paradign in wildlife utilization and management, which had a significant bearing on the hunting and survival methods of local people.

In the last decades, Rondônia’s population has grown tenfold and the state has lost over 25% of its native forest cover. The state today is characterized by a concentrated and confused land ownership situation which has fueled land conflicts and predatory economic activity such as illegal logging, mining, and drug smuggling. In an effort to confront some of these problems, the World Bank implemented the Northwest Integrated Development Program (POLONOROESTE) during the 1980s. This project, while it comprised a series of complementary activities, ranging from infrastructure development and agricultural extension to health care, was best known for paving a highway. Despite the fact that Bank funding was employed to pave a road already carved out of the rainforest and designed with social mitigation mechanisms, POLONOROESTE is today strongly associated with the rapid deforestation and social conflict which ensued in the state.<BR>'Rondônia Natural Resources Management Project' or PLANAFLORO is a project designed by the State Government of Rondônia in part to offset some of the social development problems not addressed by POLONOROESTE. PLANAFLORO’s focus extended beyond traditional integrated rural development to incorporate elements of natural resource management and environmental conservation, including such varied activities as road pavement, agricultural extension, indigenous land demarcation, rural credit, education, creation of environmental parks, and institution building. One of the principal features of the project was land-use zoning, which divides the state into different macro-zones according to their suitability for agriculture, forestry, extractivism or environmental conservation. The project was intended to benefit some 60,000 small-scale farmers, traditional populations, and residents of small interior towns. <BR>The complexity and richness of the organisations involved in PLANAFLORO is perhaps the most unique feature of the project experience. PLANAFLORO was executed with financial support from the World Bank and with technical support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). A wide range of environmental and other NGOs have been involved in the establishment and implementation of extractive reserves in Rondônia: Rondônia Organisation of Rubber Tappers (OSR), WWF, OXFAM, Rainforest Action Network, ECOSCAMBIO, etc. The government agencies legally responsible for establishing, developing and managing extractive reserves are the State Agency for Environmental Development (SEDAM), and the Rondônia Institute of Land Colonisation (ITERON). <BR>During the Fund’s first year of operation in 1997, a total of 146 projects were funded  benefiting an estimated 18,800 families. While the Fund was clearly designed with an environmental focus, most of the projects in this phase were in the area of income generation activities (43.8%), followed by health and education activities (35.9%), and infrastructure projects (8.7%). Despite its auspicious beginnings PLANAFLORO soon faced difficulties meeting its ambitious goals. However, after a mid-term review and project restructuring, PLANAFLORO’s performance has improved. In fact, thanks primarily to PLANAFLORO, nearly 30% of Rondônia’s territory, or approximately 66,000 square kilometers, is today demarcated as conservation units or indigenous reserves. Furthermore, the nearly completed 'second approximation' of the agro-ecological zoning will provide a useful and current map of the land-use patterns of the state.<BR>Despite being an often confrontational process, the PLANAFLORO experience demonstrated that effective participatory approaches can be successful in improving project implementation.","Thanks primarily to PLANAFLORO, nearly 30% of Rondônia’s territory, or approximately 66,000 square kilometers, is now demarcated as conservation units or indigenous reserves.","During the Fund’s first year of operation in 1997, a total of 146 projects were funded  benefiting an estimated 18,800 families.

It is surrounded by impoverished farmers with a mean per capita cash income estimated at less than $50. In 1991, 96% of the farmers were unhappy with the forest and 54% wanted it completely cleared for settlement.

Most importantly, a 1998 survey of the butterfly farmers showed a major change in attitudes: 84% now support the forest.

In that geographic zone the water precipitation is scarce, the population presents low formal educational skills, there are not enough job opportunities, and the income of a major part of the population is below US$ 1,00 per day. Due to the arid environment, agriculture is virtually impossible. Practically, the only viable cultivation on such a dry ecosystem is Sisal, a natural fiber used in the textile industry. Up to the 70’s Sisal fiber was the main option for production of ropes and cordages, reaching quotes as high as US$ 1,000,00 per metric ton. With the competition of the synthetics, Sisal fiber saw its quotation going down to levels as low as US$ 100,00 per metric ton within a few years. It was in that context of an impoverished sisal culture, APAEB was founded in 1980. Due to the lack of alternatives, sisal continued to be a major produce for small farmers, who besides having to bear the low prices, had also to deal with the harmful activity of middlemen.<BR>Thanks to the organization, the small farmers were able to collectively process and sell their produce, achieving better prices, and thus creating better working conditions for the farmers. With perseverant effort, APAEB was able to set up first in 1984 one brushing station, which allowed the small farmer to improve their returns by overcoming middleman’s perverse speculation. Later, the Association of Small Farmers finally secured an export license, and most important, the possibility of receiving dollars for their crops. In 1996, with the support of collaborating organizations, APAEB set up a carpet industry, allowing the association to leap into a new stage of development. Two years later, APAEB was the major private employer in the region. As employment opportunities increased by four, reaching 800 direct jobs.<BR>Nowadays, the scope of APAEB has evolved into a much broader spectrum of initiatives, which goes well beyond direct job creation and value adding activities. The mission is to create self-sustainable local development, by showing to the farmers how they can help themselves. Activities carried out to achieve this goal include goat raising and training programs.","APAEB belives that environmental issues have a direct impact on the quality of life of the population and for this reason have financed reforestation and water saving initiatives.","Currently 3000 families benefit from APAEB actions such as direct and indirect jobs, technical assistance, educational initiatives or financial credit.

At the beginning of the project, there were several thousand people from nomadic and settled communities using its natural resources, mostly for hunting and the grazing of goats and sheep. The impact of this use on the ecology was obvious to see in terms of degraded rangeland soil erosion, and almost zero tree regeneration.<BR>In 1993 a unique Programme began in the Dana Wildlands of southern Jordan, under the supervision of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN), a long established NGO with a mandate to establish and manage protected areas. The Programme was the first attempt in Jordan, and probably the Middle East, to try and link the conservation of biodiversity with the socio-economic development targeting local communities living in and around the protected area. Priorities of the programme were established through baseline assessments of the ecology and local communities by RSCN, and a resource use study was carried out to define stakeholders. The main priorities were: to contribute to the management of the site as an integral part of the Jordanian national heritage, and as a site of international importance for nature conservation, scenic and archaeological significance; to provide for the socio-economic welfare and capacity building of the local communities, and to create partnerships with the communities and involve them in the management of the Reserve and in the decision making process.<BR>Until now, a total of 179 local men and women have benefited directly from jobs or purchase of goods and services and consequently some of the Dana households have experienced a 10-fold increase in income as a result of the programme. More importantly, the villagers themselves have started to exploit the growing number of tourists attracted by the protected area, and are creating home-grown initiatives which represent a visible example of the capacity building within the local community resulting from the programme's emphasis on income generation.

This scenario leads to persistent food shortages.  Occasionally, the community receives food relief from the government and NGOs to fill the gap. Charcoal burning is the main income generating activity due to ready market. Natural woodlands are increasingly being overexploited leading to land degradation and reduced land productivity. Indigenous trees that have various uses are among the species lost in the process. In 1999, an impact assessment for World Neighbours Kitui revealed that charcoal burning remained a major source of income.  <BR>Modern beekeeping was introduced to improve farm production and develop new methods of increasing household income without environmental destruction. Two hundred langstroth hives were purchased and distributed to 4 self-help groups in 4 villages. The average production per hive per year gave 21 kgs of honey compared to local hives, which give a maximum of 8 kgs of honey per hive per year. In June 2003, additional 500 more hives were purchased and by February 2004, the farmers had harvested 300 kgs of honey selling at a price of Ksh. 110 per kg. The price of honey sold is equivalent to 471 bags of charcoal at a local price of Ksh. 70 per bag.<BR>To maximize the benefits, promotion of sunflower, which includes simple and cheap oil extraction technology, provides the community with alternative source of edible oil while providing the bees with nectar.

These problems led to various impacts that included a loss in mangrove forest habitat and marine biodiversity, low income from decreasing fish and marine catch sales and a rise in poverty levels in the village.<BR>The initiative's long-term goal is to establish an integrated coastal resource management. The more immediate priorities were drawn up by the community groups comprising of women, fishermen, youth, mangrove cutters, leaders among others after a series of meetings. The first priority was the rehabilitation of degraded mangrove sites. This was due to the immense ecological role mangroves play in the coastal ecosystem. Secondly they resolved to raise community awareness over the government's issuance of mangrove harvesting licenses. They felt that overexploitation and illegal clear felling was unchecked and they wanted the quotas to be strictly adhered to by licensees. The last priority was building the capacity of the community for sustainable management of their coastal resources.<BR>Various results have already been achieved.

Further wildlife gazetting is being prepared under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment.","Since the 80's the primary employment in the Lower Kinabatangan has been in fishing, farming and civil service. Many also make money by leasing out their land to oil palm estates. Rainforest along the Kinabatangan River is being removed and replaced with oil palms, leading to heavily silting and pollution of the Kinabatangan. The deforestation of the lower Kinabatangan has resulted in increasing elephant-human conflict. Serious health and lifestyle concerns have also arisen for the local Orang Sungai villagers that rely on the river for drinking, cooking, food, washing facilities bathing, waste disposal and transportation.<BR>In 1991 Borneo Eco Tours (BET) was set up with a focus on ecotourism in Borneo. By 1995 Sukau Rainforest Lodge (SRL) was set up as an eco-lodge on the Kinabatangan for extended wildlife tours in this area. SRL is located near Sukau village, taking advantage of the large amount of wildlife concentrated in the surrounding area, while still being able to provide employment to people native to the area. In 1999 Sukau Rainforest Lodge (SRL) recognised the need to set up a division, Sukau Ecotourism Research & Development Centre (SERDC), to conduct research and development in ecotourism. Among the priorities established by SERDC were: countering the increasing threat to the biodiversity of the Lower Kinabatangan from illegal logging and commercial agriculture through greater formal protection and by providing alternate local income sources derived through ecotourism; plan long term environmentally sustainable and culturally appropriate strategies for the region with all stakeholders; identify and prioritise community and environmental projects.<BR>The initiative has already achieved numerous results. The local community has gained a steady income both through local staff full time at SRL and local contractors. Five eco-lodges have opened in the Sukau region resulting in even less dependence on oil palm and lumber companies for income, and more jobs in the region. 90% of the staff at SRL are from the local region, including the lodge manager. Staff at SRL have also received considerable personal development in the form of reading, language and financial skills. Due to the income derived from ecotourism, the population of Sukau are much more environmentally conscious and seek to protect the local environment from short term environmentally degrading projects. Villages of Sukau also gain additional income by collecting seeds and growing seedlings for sale to SRL. The seedlings are used to replant 64 acres of degraded land on the wildlife corridor along the river, which was adopted on the 4th June 2000 by SRL.","Alternative sources of income have resulted in less dependence of the local community from oil palm and lumber companies for inocme. 26,000 ha of the lower Kinabatangan was originally planned as a wildlife sanctuary in 1999, and on 16th January 2002 it was gazetted under the Land Ordinance.

To arrest this situation, the State government of Johor took a bold step to establish the National Parks (Johor) Corporation on 1 January 1992, under a State law called The National Parks (Johor) Corporation Enactment. The main functions of the Corporation are to create, develop and manage nature parks so as to conserve the natural environment. Parks set up under this Enactment are recognised by the IUCN as category II Protected Areas. In 1993 the Corporation set up the first Park, the Endau-Rompin (Johor) National Park. Since then, it has advised the State Government to designate four other areas as Parks. They represent a variety of habitats such as Lowland Dipterocarp Rainforest (Endau-Rompin), Mangroves (Kukup Island and Tanjung Piai), Sub-Montane (Gunung Ledang) and Marine (Mersing Islands). <BR>Until recently, the Corporation's efforts have been mainly focussed on the development and management of the Endau-Rompin Park. The Corporation has adopted several strategies in Endau-Rompin, such as: adhering to a strict zonation system; establishing a Nature Education and Research Centre (NERC); drawing up a Management and Development Plan and a Master Plan for Scientific Research; promoting various nature-based recreation activities for students and adults, both local and overseas. Acceptance by the local community was a major hurdle for the Corporation in the case of Endau-Rompin as they feared the loss of their traditional livelihood and ancestral lands. A crucial decision that won over many villagers was the Corporation's recognition of the community's right to traditional extraction of forest resources and ownership of their fruit trees within the Park. In addition, the Corporation has adopted the policy of hiring people from the local communities for the Park's needs, despite their sometimes lack of qualifications. <BR>The commitment of the Johor State government towards conservation has resulted in major changes in local environmental policies and strategies. More national parks have been identified by the Corporation and approved by the State government. One notable achievement is the creation of job opportunities for the local communities. Many households in Endau-Rompin have at least one member, who works as a guide, boatman or park staff. Many earn incomes averaging RM 600 per month. This regular income has raised many households substantially above the poverty line. It also indirectly helps to overcome the problems of poaching and deforestation. Enterprise development has also taken place. For instance the boat services and the Park canteen are operated by individuals from the local community while several households sell handicraft to Park visitors. This means the project had an element of empowerment for the local community.","The concepts of recycling and maintenance of the surroundings have been introduced to promote a better living environment. The local communities are gradually developing more concern towards sustainable resource utilization. Those employed as Park staff, guides, boatmen or part-time workers now spend less time on traditional economic activities such as hunting and fishing.","Park staff from the local community have a regular monthly income. Guides and boatmen derive an income from Park visitors. A family from the local community operates the Park cafeteria. Increased financial ability has enabled individuals to purchase motorbikes for greater mobility and independence. Many households are now substantially above the poverty line and are now more financially able to meet the educational needs of their children.

Poachers took sometimes one flipper and left the rest to rot, while tourists came to view the turtles in large numbers, in this way disturbing the nesting process. In response to this situation, the government initially established a Prohibited Area under the Forest Act in 1990 to regulate the number of people that visit the beach. In the same year, the government made the first step to reach out to the community to seek their assistance in the conservation effort. As a consequence, a tour guide course was held and a community based organisation was formed (Nature Seekers Incorporated (NSI)).<BR>The following objectives were established together by the government Forestry Division and Nature Seekers Inc. The main idea was to put the environment first and to initiate a Co-management arrangement between the government and the community. Some of the more specific objectives that were agreed upon were: to safeguard the nesting habitat of marine turtles and other natural resources from negative impacts; to develop awareness of the significance and value of the local habitat; to promote ecotourism as a tool for conservation of natural ecosystems, using the spectacular ecological behavior of the nesting Leatherback Turtles as the principle focus for this activity, and training young people in the community as nature tour guides and for other entrepreneurial activities.<BR>In the early stage, the government funded the monitoring and research programme that the community was responsible for implementing. A few years after, NSI members went to training courses to learn the process of proposals writing and started identifying funding sources, both local and international, to support the turtle conservation programme. At the beginning, the villagers opposed the idea of the protected area because they were afraid this measure would hinder their fishing and recreation activities on the beach. The solution was to ensure that all members of the community would receive free permits to access the beach. The second major problem was poachers who killed turtles on a nightly basis. The solution was found inviting the children of the poachers to protect the turtle throughout the turtle season. This was so effective, that in one season approximately eight poachers and children of poachers were turned into conservationist.  <BR>Great success has already been achieved by the project: slaughtering of Leatherback Turtles has almost stopped and turtles can now nest undisturbed at Matura beach; the involvement and commitment of the members of the community has greatly increased since the inception of the programme, as well as their capacity building; employment levels have increased as a direct result of the programme in the form of Tour Guides and Turtles Taggers;

to develop awareness of the significance and value of the local habitat; to promote ecotourism as a tool for conservation of natural ecosystems using the spectacular ecological behavior of the nesting leatherback turtles as the principle focus for this activity and training young people in the community as nature tour guides and for other entrepreneurial activities in the early stage the government funded the monitoring and research programme that the community was responsible for implementing a few years after nsi members went to training courses to learn the process of proposals writing and started identifying funding sources both local and international to support the turtle conservation programme at the beginning the villagers opposed the idea of the protected area because they were afraid this measure would hinder their fishing and recreation activities on the beach the solution was to ensure that all members of the community would receive free permits to access the beach the second major problem was poachers who killed turtles on a nightly basis the solution was found inviting the children of the poachers to protect the turtle throughout the turtle season this was so effective that in one season approximately eight poachers and children of poachers were turned into conservationist great success has already been achieved by the project slaughtering of leatherback turtles has almost stopped and turtles can now nest undisturbed at matura beach;

Yet, other driving forces were equally responsible for the destruction of the island’s forests.

Opportunities for rebuilding the community, dispersed and displaced by the military for decades, appeared in 1996 when the government returned 70,000 hectares of land, followed by another 4,000 hectares in 2004. With its land restored, the community faced two distinct challenges that became the focal points of the intervention strategies sponsored by the Group for Environmental Monitoring (GEM) and IUCN-South Africa (IUCN-SA), WWF's local partners in South Africa. The first challenge was to overcome internal divisions in the community and build entrepreneurial capacity so the community could embark on commercial endeavors — notably ecotourism (which offers in this area the most reliable means of achieving the twin goals of poverty reduction and nature conservation) small-scale mining and diversified agriculture - to raise incomes. The second challenge was to build internal community cohesion to obtain development funds from the district and provincial governments for infrastructure and economic development, in keeping with the government’s institutional reform programs.<BR>With these goals in mind, IUCN-SA and GEM embarked on a multitude of training and capacity-building activities with community members. Management training for the community trust was provided, communications infrastructure was offered for this previously isolated area, and contacts with nearby capital- intensive farming operations were established.

It was around these ancient tank (water storage reservoir) irrigation systems that the economy and human settlements of early Sri Lankan society were organised. Today’s map of Sri Lanka is dotted with literally thousands of ancient tanks of varying sizes and shapes. Providing irrigation water, domestic supplies and natural resources to millions of people, they also constitute one of the richest sources of wetland biodiversity in the country. Yet traditional tank systems are also under severe, and increasing, threats, which arise from multiple sources, including upstream water allocation decisions which marginalise traditional tank systems in favour of seemingly more productive uses such as 'modern' large-scale irrigation and hydropower, as well as from siltation and sedimentation arising from unsustainable land use practices in upper catchments.<BR>The Kala Oya Basin has been identified by the government as the pilot river basin to plan and implement integrated river basin management approaches in Sri Lanka. Kala Oya is one of 103 river basins in Sri Lanka and is situated in the Northwestern dry zone of the country. The majority of water in Kala Oya is allocated to irrigation. There are about 600 small irrigation tanks within the basin, as well as 'modern' irrigation systems including the large-scale Mahaweli Irrigation Expansion Project. The Kala Oya Basin contains a largely rural population of some 400,000 people, most of whom are engaged in farming as their main form of livelihood. Cultivation of rice and other crops is combined with fishing and the harvesting of wild plants and animals. There is a particularly high incidence of poverty in this area.<BR>The project implemented in Kala Oya Basin by IUCN, in collaboration with the MASL, the primary river basin management institution in the country, intended to integrate downstream wetland values into land use and water allocation decisions. A first step was to determine the environmental and economic benefits associated with small tanks in the Kala Oya Basin. The results of the valuation study showed that tanks in the Rajangana and Angamauwa sub catchments of the Kala Oya Basin yield an average value of US$ 425 per household per year in terms of water and aquatic resource use, or almost $3,000 per hectare of inundated area.

The aim of the project was to help farmers establish more than 150 ha of windbreaks, made of a mix of indigenous and exotic tree species. The economic returns from the windbreaks are very high, even without considering the timber products, because wind protection results in higher coffee and milk yields, reduced calf mortality and morbidity, and higher herd-carrying capacity of pastures.

The nutrients in these soils are not suited for continuous grain cultivation and farmers can only cultivate these lands one out of every two or three years. The rest of the time farmers must leave the land fallow to restore its nutrients, and to control weeds, pests, and diseases. Given the characteristics of this soil, the chitemene shifting cultivation system has dominated most of northern Zambia for a long time. In this system, farmers chop down a large area of trees, pile the trunks onto a smaller area, and burn them. Then they grow crops in the ash for a few years. The fire releases the nutrients in the woody biomass and makes them available for crops and provides a seedbed free of weeds. In more populated areas, fallow periods were too short for woodlands to regenerate, so the forests were gradually replaced by grasslands. Uncontrolled fires were common in this system as well, and affected the regrowth of woody vegetation and species composition. In the first half of the 20th century, the British introduced cassava, a starchy root crop from Brazil, to northern Zambia, with the objectives of controlling deforestation and permitting the land to support more than the 2.2-2.5 persons per square kilometer permitted by the chitemene system. Although farmers initially resisted the new crop, they gradually discovered its advantages and it eventually became most people’s main staple, producing good yields even in poor soils where most other crops failed.","The introduction of cassava reduced deforestation by increasing land productivity.","Household models suggest that cassava boosted the number of people the land could support by two to six times relative to the chitemene system, and that households could meet their food requirements with 40 percent less labor input, giving them much larger surpluses for sale.","EA|","http://www.ecoagriculturepartners.org/cases/CSIII.htm","McNeely, J.A. and Scherr, S.J., 2003, 'Common Ground, Common Future: How Ecoagriculture Can Feed the World and Save Wild Biodiversity', Ecoagriculture, Island Press",,". introduction of cassava to reduce deforestation in zambia northern region of zambia ecosystem landscape local communities of farmers control deforestation enhance land productivity most of northern zambia is open miombo woodland the nutrients in these soils are not suited for continuous grain cultivation and farmers can only cultivate these lands one out of every two or three years the rest of the time farmers must leave the land fallow to restore its nutrients and to control weeds pests and diseases given the characteristics of this soil the chitemene shifting cultivation system has dominated most of northern zambia for a long time in this system farmers chop down a large area of trees pile the trunks onto a smaller area and burn them then they grow crops in the ash for a few years the fire releases the nutrients in the woody biomass and makes them available for crops and provides a seedbed free of weeds in more populated areas fallow periods were too short for woodlands to regenerate so the forests were gradually replaced by grasslands uncontrolled fires were common in this system as well and affected the regrowth of woody vegetation and species composition in the first half of the 20th century the british introduced cassava a starchy root crop from brazil to northern zambia with the objectives of controlling deforestation and permitting the land to support more than the 2 2 2 5 persons per square kilometer permitted by the chitemene system although farmers initially resisted the new crop they gradually discovered its advantages and it eventually became most people’s main staple producing good yields even in poor soils where most other crops failed the introduction of cassava reduced deforestation by increasing land productivity household models suggest that cassava boosted the number of people the land could support by two to six times relative to the chitemene system and that households could meet their food requirements with 40 percent less labor input giving them much larger surpluses for sale .",,,NULL,NULL

Significant deforestation occurred prior to the mid-1970s, due to overlogging and frontier agricultural settlement. Since then, commercial logging has been sharply controlled. However, conversion of forest to farmland has continued as a result of a 2.3% annual rural population growth rate, and widespread erosion and nutrient depletion in steep fields used for low-value staple food crops. Forest habitat and wild populations of deer, agouti, raccoon, various squirrels, and other native fauna and flora have declined sharply. But a different pattern of land use has emerged in some of the region’s communities as a result of research and extension by the National Coffee Program of Honduras and the local Pan-American Agricultural School of Zamorano. In the 1980s the Zamorano School identified many fruit and vegetable varieties suitable for local steepland conditions, and developed integrated nutrient and pest management strategies and sprinkler irrigation and conservation practices. The Coffee Program encouraged coffee-growing communities to intensify production of basic grains, and to replace traditional coffee with higher-yielding varieties. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, communities occupying a third of the area of the central region adopted these new technologies. Higher incomes from vegetables and coffee enabled farmers to purchase fertilizers to replenish soil nutrients, thus nearly doubling maize yields on permanent fields.","Marginal fallowed fields were reverted to forest. In particular, aerial photograph analysis shows that the net area under forest cover remained stable, since the introduction of improved crop technology, in the coffee-growing communities, declined only slightly in the horticultural communities, while the decline in the forest cover was between 13 and 20% in the grains communities.","Thanks to improved crop technology, farmers have experienced a significant increase in income from the cultivation of vegetables and coffee.","EA|","http://www.ecoagriculturepartners.org/cases/CSIII.htm","McNeely, J.A. and Scherr, S.J., 2003, 'Common Ground, Common Future: How Ecoagriculture Can Feed the World and Save Wild Biodiversity', Ecoagriculture, Island Press",,". regenerating native pine forest habitat in honduras through improved crop technology national coffee program of honduras and the local pan american agricultural school of zamorano central region of honduras ecosystem landscape local farming communities conserve the native pine forest habitat increase farmers income through improved crop technology the central region of honduras was originally completely forested but today only about half of the area is covered by native pine forest with scattered deciduous forest stands significant deforestation occurred prior to the mid 1970s due to overlogging and frontier agricultural settlement since then commercial logging has been sharply controlled however conversion of forest to farmland has continued as a result of a 2 3% annual rural population growth rate and widespread erosion and nutrient depletion in steep fields used for low value staple food crops forest habitat and wild populations of deer agouti raccoon various squirrels and other native fauna and flora have declined sharply but a different pattern of land use has emerged in some of the region’s communities as a result of research and extension by the national coffee program of honduras and the local pan american agricultural school of zamorano in the 1980s the zamorano school identified many fruit and vegetable varieties suitable for local steepland conditions and developed integrated nutrient and pest management strategies and sprinkler irrigation and conservation practices the coffee program encouraged coffee growing communities to intensify production of basic grains and to replace traditional coffee with higher yielding varieties in the late 1980s and early 1990s communities occupying a third of the area of the central region adopted these new technologies higher incomes from vegetables and coffee enabled farmers to purchase fertilizers to replenish soil nutrients thus nearly doubling maize yields on permanent fields marginal fallowed fields were reverted to forest in particular aerial photograph analysis shows that the net area under forest cover remained stable since the introduction of improved crop technology in the coffee growing communities declined only slightly in the horticultural communities while the decline in the forest cover was between 13 and 20% in the grains communities thanks to improved crop technology farmers have experienced a significant increase in income from the cultivation of vegetables and coffee .",,,NULL,NULL

Major buyers of cocoa,  believe it likely that the most promising option for long-term, sustainable cocoa production is with small-scale, organic systems. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is drawing upon these scientific advances to help protect the Talamanca/Bocas de Toro reserve. The reserve encompasses more than 30,000 ha of private lands, indigenous reserves, and coastal zones in Costa Rica, and 14,000 ha of coral reefs, mangroves, and lagoons in Panama. More than 358 species of birds, of which over 100 are North American migrants, depend on this intact forest for their survival. The Talamanca Corridor in Costa Rica is a major buffer zone for the reserve. Along one side of the Corridor are 400 small-scale producers of shaded cocoa who, for lack of capital, were unable to apply many purchased inputs to their crop before the TNC began its program. Their incomes had dropped and some farmers had begun to cut down their cocoa and shade trees to plant annual crops. To halt this land use change in the buffer zone, the TNC program promoted organic cocoa production. Financing for the program came from the EcoEnterprise Fund, a venture capital fund co-financed by TNC, the Inter-American Development Bank, and private investors for environmentally compatible businesses.","As a result of the project, farmers have stopped cutting down their trees and are expanding the area under cocoa. A study of bird populations in the organic cocoa buffer zone found a higher number of species than in the forested areas because of the edge effects of the cocoa-forest mosaic.","This project has enabled 1,500 farmers to produce for the more lucrative organic cocoa markets, using new, higher-productivity organic management techniques.

The national government, however, proved unable to manage all these resources effectively and by the 1980s less than half of India's forest land had good tree cover, while non timber forest products had started to become scarce. Confronted with this situation, thousands of communities decided to take action to protect their forests. They organized hamlet-based forest protection groups that halted cutting and grazing, often leading to a rapid regeneration of natural forests. Researchers and NGOs, recognizing the potential of communities participation, began to support these village initiatives by developing methods to accelerate natural regeneration and to manage sustainable product extraction. After a new National Forest Policy was passed in 1988 that identified the need to motivate forest communities to develop and protect their forests, several states allocated partial public forest management authority to forest communities. Finally, in 1990 the National Joint Forest Management resolution was passed, which supported the rights and responsibilities of forest communities. Today, an estimated 30,000 village-level committees are protecting and regenerating 10 million ha of forests. Although there are still major issues to be resolved in fully empowering local communities in JFM, economic as well as environmental benefits are significant in many areas.","Forest's biodiversity has been greatly enhanced, while biodiversity has also been enhanced in adjacent areas because the environmental services of forests are recovering.

A growing number of scientists, administrators, and policy-makers now acknowledge that unless local communities are effectively involved in establishing sustainable forest management systems, deforestation will continue at a rapid rate. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) began a programme of JFM (joint forest management) in the Haryana Shivaliks in July 1990 in collaboration with the HFD (Haryana forest department), with financial support from the Ford Foundation. The programme site is located in the Himalayan foothills of northern India covering about 3000 square kilometers of north and north-eastern Haryana. The tract is hilly with rugged and ondulating topography. The local population consists of Gujjar, Jat, Ramdaisya, Rajput, Banjare, and Bhanjda castes. The economy of the area is primarily dependent on agriculture and livestock. The programme envisages people's participation in the management of forest resources of the state jointly with HFD.<BR>As part of the project, a village-level resource management institution, popularly known as HRMS (hill resource management society), has been formed in 55 villages in the two forest divisions of the HFD. To bridge the gap between the grassroots and the HFD, three separate working groups at the range, division, and state levels have been set up. The other strategies that have been undertaken to elicit people's participation in the management and protection of degraded forests are as follows: 1) a series of small check dams have been constructed for soil conservation and water harvesting. As a result, cultivation that was earlier restricted to wheat and maize has now diversified to include rice, jowar, bajra, groundnut, and vegetables; 2) plots of forests were leased to HRMS for harvesting of bhabbar and other fodder grasses to contribute to the general economic betterment of the local communities; 3) in 1991 the monthly quota of bamboos (felling permit of bamboos) was increased from 50 to 100 per family, at Rs 7 per 100 bamboos and the felling season was extended from 6 to 9 months; 4) training programmes were organized.","The average yield of bhabbar grass has more than doubled; the total number of trees/ha has increased from a minimum of 700 in unprotected forest areas to a maximum of 3960 in case of 10 years of protection; the number of shrubs/ha is maximum in unprotected forest areas 13,885 whereas in areas protected for 10 years, it is as low as 3247.","The benefits accruing to the HRMS from the sale of surplus bhabbar grass are substantial. This money invested at the village level has largely been for such activities as forestry works, for repair of water-harvesting structures, development of infrastructure, and constructing places of worship and other civic amenities. Water-harvesting structures help villagers to increase their earning from farming through diversifying the agricultural activities. Supply of bamboos at concessional rates provides employment and a source of income.  Leasing out of forest areas to HRMS for extraction of fodder grasses helped the pastoral community to re-stock their livestock with more productive breed.","PP|SU|","http://static.teriin.org/case/jfm.htm",,"Varghese Paul <BR>E-mail: vpaul@teri.res.in",".  joint forest management in haryana teri the energy and resources institute haryana forest department hfd ford foundation north and north eastern haryana forest ecosystem local communities conserve the forests improve the livelihoods of local communities by enhancing their participation in forest s management forests in india have continued to deteriorate under pressure from the growing population a growing number of scientists administrators and policy makers now acknowledge that unless local communities are effectively involved in establishing sustainable forest management systems deforestation will continue at a rapid rate the energy and resources institute teri began a programme of jfm joint forest management in the haryana shivaliks in july 1990 in collaboration with the hfd haryana forest department with financial support from the ford foundation the programme site is located in the himalayan foothills of northern india covering about 3000 square kilometers of north and north eastern haryana the tract is hilly with rugged and ondulating topography the local population consists of gujjar jat ramdaisya rajput banjare and bhanjda castes the economy of the area is primarily dependent on agriculture and livestock the programme envisages people s participation in the management of forest resources of the state jointly with hfd as part of the project a village level resource management institution popularly known as hrms hill resource management society has been formed in 55 villages in the two forest divisions of the hfd to bridge the gap between the grassroots and the hfd three separate working groups at the range division and state levels have been set up the other strategies that have been undertaken to elicit people s participation in the management and protection of degraded forests are as follows 1 a series of small check dams have been constructed for soil conservation and water harvesting as a result cultivation that was earlier restricted to wheat and maize has now diversified to include rice jowar bajra groundnut and vegetables; 2 plots of forests were leased to hrms for harvesting of bhabbar and other fodder grasses to contribute to the general economic betterment of the local communities; 3 in 1991 the monthly quota of bamboos felling permit of bamboos was increased from 50 to 100 per family at rs 7 per 100 bamboos and the felling season was extended from 6 to 9 months; 4 training programmes were organized the average yield of bhabbar grass has more than doubled; the total number of trees ha has increased from a minimum of 700 in unprotected forest areas to a maximum of 3960 in case of 10 years of protection; the number of shrubs ha is maximum in unprotected forest areas 13 885 whereas in areas protected for 10 years it is as low as 3247 the benefits accruing to the hrms from the sale of surplus bhabbar grass are substantial this money invested at the village level has largely been for such activities as forestry works for repair of water harvesting structures development of infrastructure and constructing places of worship and other civic amenities water harvesting structures help villagers to increase their earning from farming through diversifying the agricultural activities supply of bamboos at concessional rates provides employment and a source of income leasing out of forest areas to hrms for extraction of fodder grasses helped the pastoral community to re stock their livestock with more productive breed  .",,,NULL,NULL

Preliminary studies in the BRT wildlife sanctuary indicated that the Soligas  derive about 50% of their cash income from the sale of NTFPs. It was also found that many NTFP-yielding species were not adequately regenerating, possibly due to over-harvesting.<BR>In 1994, TERI and VGKK (Vivekananda Girijana Kalyana Kendra), an NGO devoted to social, economic and health welfare of the Soligas, conceived an enterprise-based approach for the sustainable use of NTFPs, with a view to conserving the biodiversity of the BRT sanctuary. The 3-year project was designed to increase the economic stake of Soligas in conserving their biotic resources and to increase their capacity to ensure the ecological sustainability of these resources and the larger ecosystem.

In Fiji, residents of Ucunivanua village adopted an innovative solution to the problem of a rapidly degrading marine environment by retrieving their traditions of common property management. In 1990, villagers began to experiment with the historical practice of establishing taboo zones, where fishing is prohibited, to allow degraded marine areas to recover from overuse. When their experiments proved successful, they, and other communities also struggling to protect the marine environment, joined together to launch a Fiji-based network that serves as a forum for the sharing of ideas, data, and best practices.<BR>Since its inception in 1999, the Fiji Locally-Managed Marine Area Network has grown to include communities in six districts and cover 10% of the inshore marine area of Fiji. The involvement of communities in the network has led to increases in the number and size of clams, crabs, and other species harvested adjacent to taboo areas, increased household income 35% over three years, and tripled catch per unit effort. Much of the success of the initiative can be attributed to its participatory and collaborative focus, which has ensured that local people are at the center of the network's operations. Another important aspects of the network is its focus on cross-project collaboration, which sees different project teams visiting one another's sites to learn from each other and to conduct training exercises. As a proof of the success of the network in protecting marine biodiversity and alleviating poverty in fishing communities, the government of Fiji has recently incorporated many of its approaches into national policies designed to protect the coastal resources of Fiji for future generations.","The initiative has led to increases in the number and size of clams, crabs, and other species.","The Fiji Locally-Managed Marine Area Network has grown to include communities in six districts and cover 10% of the inshore marine area of Fiji.

The vision of the project is to promote the sustainable management of biodiversity in the south-east region of Cameroon while contributing to improve the living conditions for local people.<BR>The Baka pygmies, the indigenous population of this area, have long recognised the need to protect their natural environment. However, the richness of animals and plants in Cameroon's south-east forests have attracted many others whose only interest has been exploitation. Logging from foreign companies has sharply increased in the last decades. In addition, partly encouraged by insecurity in neighbouring countries and the supply of weapons it produced, more people took to poaching and the trade in bush meat flourished, as did illegal mining and the trapping of parrots.<BR>In response to this situation, and after a long negotiation phase, WWF won the support of local communities and the government for a project aimed at promoting sustainable logging and, more generally, a sustainable management of all forest resources. As part of the Jengi project, WWF has established three Protected Areas (PAs) in Lobeke, Boumba Bek and Nki, covering some 700,000 hectares of forest. A monitoring programme surveys key bio-indicators and trends, and local staff have been recruited and trained to manage the PAs. Conventions with major stakeholders have been set up against poaching.

Nuts are harvested from natural stands, not plantations, because the trees depend intimately on a complex web of pollinators, seed dispersers, and abiotic conditions. As a consequence, in many parts of the Amazon, Brazil nut harvesting depends upon agreements among neighbours and households. This is particularly true in southeastern Peru, where most Brazil nut harvesters are small-scale producers, with stands that are seldom larger than 1,000 hectares. Brazil nut production is therefore a significant model that closely links the economic, ecological and social components of sustainable development.<BR>Amazon Conservation Association's (ACA) Brazil nut Program seeks to conserve and maintain the productivity of approximately 1 million hectares of Brazil nut stands in the southwestern Amazon by establishing formal, long-term contracts between approximately 1,000 Brazil nut producers and the Peruvian Government, whereby nuts are harvested from mapped areas, according to management plans that incorporate the highest standards of sustainable forest management. <BR>As a result of this project, Brazil nut harvesting in southeastern Peru is now more compatible with biodiversity conservation, local producers have extended their opportunities to benefit financially from the activity, and potentially adverse social impacts have been avoided by resolving tenure overlaps and securing government recognition of the rights of traditional Brazil nut harvesters. The Project has also put ASCART - a small but influential local Brazil nut producers' association - on the path to long-term sustainability, with management and leadership training, business development support, and a key role in the decision-making processes surrounding all of the achievements noted above.","The project has resulted in over 224,000 hectares of primary tropical forest being legally designated for sustainable production. Of these, 27,000 hectares have the additional distinction of certification under the Forest Stewardship Council system, in recognition of producers’ adherence to the strictest international standards for forest management.","This Project has assisted over 130 pioneering Brazil nut producers in the formal establishment of Brazil nut concessions and the development of management plans.","LR|SU|","http://www.cepf.net/ImageCache/cepf/content/pdfs/final_2eaca_2ebrazilnutphasei_2epdf/v1/final.aca.brazilnutphasei.pdf",,"Cristian Vallejos, Amazon Conservation Association<BR>Phone: +1 (202) 234-2356",".  formalizing forest access and implementing sustainable brazil nut management in madre de dios peru amazon conservation association asociación para la conservación de la cuenca amazónica acca government of peru inrena brazil nut producers’ associations cesvi wwf pronaturaleza conservation international others madre de dios brazil nuts brazil nut harvesters conserve and maintain the productivity of approximately 1 million hectares of brazil nut stands imrpove livelihoods sustainability for brazil nut harvesters brazil nuts are an important renewable resource in the amazon basin nuts are harvested from natural stands not plantations because the trees depend intimately on a complex web of pollinators seed dispersers and abiotic conditions as a consequence in many parts of the amazon brazil nut harvesting depends upon agreements among neighbours and households this is particularly true in southeastern peru where most brazil nut harvesters are small scale producers with stands that are seldom larger than 1 000 hectares brazil nut production is therefore a significant model that closely links the economic ecological and social components of sustainable development amazon conservation association s aca brazil nut program seeks to conserve and maintain the productivity of approximately 1 million hectares of brazil nut stands in the southwestern amazon by establishing formal long term contracts between approximately 1 000 brazil nut producers and the peruvian government whereby nuts are harvested from mapped areas according to management plans that incorporate the highest standards of sustainable forest management as a result of this project brazil nut harvesting in southeastern peru is now more compatible with biodiversity conservation local producers have extended their opportunities to benefit financially from the activity and potentially adverse social impacts have been avoided by resolving tenure overlaps and securing government recognition of the rights of traditional brazil nut harvesters the project has also put ascart a small but influential local brazil nut producers association on the path to long term sustainability with management and leadership training business development support and a key role in the decision making processes surrounding all of the achievements noted above the project has resulted in over 224 000 hectares of primary tropical forest being legally designated for sustainable production of these 27 000 hectares have the additional distinction of certification under the forest stewardship council system in recognition of producers’ adherence to the strictest international standards for forest management this project has assisted over 130 pioneering brazil nut producers in the formal establishment of brazil nut concessions and the development of management plans  .",,,NULL,NULL

This project aims to halt the fragmentation occurring in the Río Carbón watershed that forms part of the Talamanca Caribbean Biological Corridor (TCBC) in southern Costa Rica. Talamanca is a zone of great contrasts as it is simultaneously rich in biodiversity and cultures, with poverty levels above 40%, which attracts investors that exploit natural resources and residents. The creation of sustainable production alternatives is urgently needed to improve subsistence levels and conserve biodiversity. So far, one of the few economic alternatives available has been legal or illegal forestry, which rapidly deteriorates forests and resources. To conserve the biodiversity of Talamanca, the connectivity of fragmented areas must be increased by adopting sustainable production initiatives that generate income for the local inhabitants. This project has worked in fragmented areas in the Rio Carbón watershed to connect critical areas. It also strengthened local organization and participation through training, environmental education activities, encouraging greater capacity in the local population, and raising awareness about the importance of biodiversity conservation","Some of the project's accomplishments to date in the field of conservation: four nurseries to produce trees native to Talamanca for timber, fruit, forage, and other uses were established; approximately 40,000 timber and fruit trees were planted, restoring a total area of more than 50 hectares; a biomonitoring plan and protection strategy was prepared.","Some of the project's accomplishments to date in the field of poverty reduction: 1,148 hectares of farms that are developing forest conservation and reforestation projects are receiving environmental service payments; farms using agroforestry systems with more than 11,000 trees are receiving environmental service payments; a community ecotourism network was created;  a community committee was formed to support conservation activities.","CS|PP|TP|","http://www.eco-index.org/search/results.cfm?projectID=942","http://www.corredortalamanca.org","Rosa Bustillos Lemaire, Project director<BR>Phone: +506 253-8582<BR>E-mail: corrbiol@racsa.co.cr",".  promoting connectivity and biodiversity conservation in the talamanca caribbean biological corridor asociación de organizaciones del corredor biológico talamanca caribe avina group inc critical ecosystem partnership fund cepf fundecooperación the nature conservancy programa de pequeñas donaciones ppd fondo para el medio ambiente mundial talamanca region ecosystem landscape local communities protect the natural resources of talamanca by connecting forested areas in the region develop sustainable production activities for biodiversity conservation the association of organizations of the talamanca caribbean biological corridor asociación de organizaciones del corredor biológico talamanca caribe represents 16 organizations from the talamanca region and more than 650 community members this project aims to halt the fragmentation occurring in the río carbón watershed that forms part of the talamanca caribbean biological corridor tcbc in southern costa rica talamanca is a zone of great contrasts as it is simultaneously rich in biodiversity and cultures with poverty levels above 40% which attracts investors that exploit natural resources and residents the creation of sustainable production alternatives is urgently needed to improve subsistence levels and conserve biodiversity so far one of the few economic alternatives available has been legal or illegal forestry which rapidly deteriorates forests and resources to conserve the biodiversity of talamanca the connectivity of fragmented areas must be increased by adopting sustainable production initiatives that generate income for the local inhabitants this project has worked in fragmented areas in the rio carbón watershed to connect critical areas it also strengthened local organization and participation through training environmental education activities encouraging greater capacity in the local population and raising awareness about the importance of biodiversity conservation some of the project s accomplishments to date in the field of conservation four nurseries to produce trees native to talamanca for timber fruit forage and other uses were established; approximately 40 000 timber and fruit trees were planted restoring a total area of more than 50 hectares; a biomonitoring plan and protection strategy was prepared some of the project s accomplishments to date in the field of poverty reduction 1 148 hectares of farms that are developing forest conservation and reforestation projects are receiving environmental service payments; farms using agroforestry systems with more than 11 000 trees are receiving environmental service payments; a community ecotourism network was created; a community committee was formed to support conservation activities  .",,,NULL,NULL

This eliminated the felling of standing trees (the traditional form of forest extraction) and made use of the trees that fell naturally, selling the wood in the local market. This methodology does not alter intact forests and avoids the impacts caused by artificial felling; respects the original structure and composition of managed forests, avoiding alterations to the vegetation as much as possible; causes minimal changes to the landscape, avoiding physical disturbances to the habitats; doesn’t affect the behavior of the fauna moving between Corcovado National Park and Cabo Matapalo; and most importantly, it makes use of an available resource that is easily accessible, has high value, and can be sold in the marketplace.

Due to a lack of proper management of the biodiversity in this area, the last decades have witnessed a growing deterioration of the riparian and mountain forests and grasslands. In addition, invasive species, such as scarlet fierthorns (Pyracantha coccinea), privets (Ligustrum sp.) and honeysuckles (Lonicera japanica) are present in the majority of the habitats of the area. Finally, there is a lack of regulations and control of public land use, such as tourism, sports activities, extractive uses, and waste management. The principal causes of this situation were found in the absence of park rangers, a lack of information and environmental education regarding protected areas at the local and national level, as well as the social and economically depressed situation of the local community. In response to this situation, the project 'Conservation of Arequita Park' set out to achieve the following objectives: preserve the habitat of significant endemic species; apply management measures for the restoration, protection, and management of the riparian and mountain forests, grasslands, and native fauna; support environmental education and research regarding the conservation of local flora, fauna, and ecosystems; provide an environment for rest and recreational activities compatible with conservation goals, such as camping and bathing areas along the river; provide local inhabitants with sustainable development alternatives.","The growth of exotic species has been partially controlled.","Local inhabitants have been trained as nature guides.

Ecomadera helps campesino and indigenous communities with large forest landholdings to make the transition from forest exploitation to the sustainable management of productive forests. It helps communities establish nurseries and agroforestry plantations on failing farmland. In addition, Ecomadera helps communities establish businesses that produce high-quality wood products and that access markets as close to the final consumer as possible. The goal of the project is help poor rural communities conserve their valuable forest resources and build a sustainable local economy by creating new jobs in forestry, wood processing, marketing, and business administration, and by paying landowners considerably higher prices for legal timber so that they can generate higher levels of income while harvesting fewer trees. By creating businesses and skilled jobs in woodworking and forestry that pay higher wages than illegally harvesting timber, Ecomadera hopes to slow the rate of unsustainable timber harvesting in Ecuador.","Three community foresters were trained and are now working full-time for Ecomadera.

CSPA partners include NGOs and numerous producers, as well as international manufacturers and retailers (e.g. IKEA, Gibson Musical Instruments, Kraft Foods, Sara Lee, and Chiquita Brands International), and various brokers and importers (e.g. North American Wood Products, International Wood Specialties, Forest World Group, Neumann Kaffee Gruppe, ECOM, VOLCAFE). These partners have committed to incorporate increasing amounts of Rainforest Alliance-certified sustainable products into their supply stream. Some partners have also committed to provide technical assistance to farms and support research for the development of improved training services for producers and technical assistance personnel. The goal of the partnership is to transform the way that participating companies source products, thus establishing alternative ways of doing business that the companies can replicate after the completion of this effort. During the three-year activity period, over 300,000 acres of forest and farmland are expected to be certified as sustainably managed. Over four million board feet of certified timber, 90 million boxes of certified bananas and 30,000 metric tons of sustainable coffee are expected to be sold through valuable sourcing contracts provided to local operations. The Certified Sustainable Products Alliance project is focusing on areas of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, especially on the outskirts of parks, in priority watersheds and as part of biological corridors. Through its forestry and agricultural certification programs, the Rainforest Alliance brings together industry, environmentalists, scientists, local communities, workers and governments into mutually beneficial arrangements that foster sustainable production methods that benefit both Latin America's economy and environment.

The main functions of wetlands are to control floods, replace underground water during times of droughts, contribute to the retention of sediments and to water purification. Moreover, wetlands are a source of tourism and recreation, and are an area of scientific interest due to their high biodiversity. It is therefore in the interest of the local communities to conserve the wetlands ecosystem through the development of ecotourism. In particular, a proposal was made to improve the socio-economic conditions of 20 families who live on the outskirts of the La Segua and La Sabana wetlands, by training them as tourists' guides and as managers of natural resources in general.

Its poverty-stricken population, called Vezo, is entirely dependent on marine resources for subsistence. Octopus constitutes the largest portion of marine life harvested in the region, caught through a fishing technique that is destructive to the underlying reef habitat. Changes in the international market have dramatically increased the value of octopus and the quantity harvested. Fisheries data and observations from fishermen now indicate that octopus is overexploited.

These resolutions gave back to the local communities the authority on the mangrove ecosystem.<BR>Since the 1980s, Muisne has witnessed more than 85% of its mangrove forest being devastated by the shrimp industry. The destruction of the mangrove ecosystem has led to severe ecologial and social consequences for the community of Muisne. The loss of numerous species of fauna and flora, frequent floods and the critical levels of poverty are just some of the consequences of the loss of the mangrove forest and of its biodiversity. This increasingly worstening situation uncovered the necessity of finding new ways of managing the mangrove forest, which aim not only to conserve the ecosystem, but also to create alternative sources of income for the local population, without depleting the natural resources. As a consequence, the project 'Sustainable Management and Commercialisation of Seashells in Captivity' was proposed. This project carries two important aspects: on one hand, the repopulation, management and monitoring of two species of seashells, Anadara Similis and Anadara Racemosa; on the other hand, the controlled extraction of seashells grown in captivity carried out by the local population.<BR>The eight local participating associations are all carrying out a part of this project aimed at conserving the seashells species whilst contributing to the local economy.

The protected area is located 13 km east of the capital Roseau in the highlands of south-central Dominica. Covering a total area of 6,857 ha, the park includes the headwaters of most major streams and rivers in the southern half of the island, protects large tracts of almost intact tropical forest, and is important for imperial and red-necked Amazon parrots. Only a few small-holder farmers live near the park, which is characterised by limited road access. However, the area is used to produce hydroelectric power, an activity that is causing a range of environmental problems, like soil erosion and stream sedimentation. Other threats are posed to the park by the increasing number of tourists and of wild animals, a consequence of the complete ban on hunting in the park. Finally, a recent fall in the price of bananas and other crops on the international market has forced the populations living in the area surrounding the WH sites to look for alternative livelihoods.<BR>In response to this situation, COMPACT* strategy in Dominica is to provide local residents with sustainable alternative livelihoods opportunities. Between 2001 and 2004 COMPACT approved various projects that fall into three main categories: (i) ecotourism; (ii) ecoagriculture; (iii) small-scale income generation activities based on resources from the park buffer zone.

The area was legally established as a Forest Reserve in 1932, gazetted as a national park in 1949 and inscribed in the World Heritage List in 1997. Mount Kenya is the second highest mountain in Africa after Kilimanjaro, and is a vital water catchment for some 7 million people. The forest zone hosts important populations of several threatened animal species, and has one of the most impressive snow-capped landscapes in East Africa. The site constitutes a major destination in Kenya for eco-tourism and is regarded as a sacred mountain by local Kikuyu and Meru communities living in the peripheral zone of the mountain. The main threats to the forest area around Mt. Kenya are: illegal logging, firewood collection, poaching, charcoal burning, destructive honey collecting, settlement and encroachment. Human interference in the park is heterogeneous but more serious at lower altitudes.<BR>Most of the key threats identified by COMPACT* during its baseline assessment relate to illegal and destructive activities carried out by local people to earn a living. Alternative income generation linked to the promotion of conservation were therefore given top priority by COMPACT. Other activities prioritized by COMPACT site strategy, launched in 2001, included electric fencing to protect farms from elephants, community tree planting on plantation lands, improved municipal waste management, construction of an information and education centre, and facilitation of community inputs to the protected area management planning process.<BR>* In 1999, the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme (SGP) joined efforts with the United Nations Foundation (UNF) to launch a partnership initiative entitled ‘Community Management of Protected Areas for Conservation’ (COMPACT).

Today, Mount Kilimanjaro National Park extends for 75,353 ha, and it is surrounded by a forest reserve of 107,828 ha. The national park was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1989. Mt. Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa, and is a critical water catchment for Tanzania, generating some 20% of the nation’s electricity in hydropower. According to the 1988 census, the human population on Mt. Kilimanjaro was 840,386. Indigenous people make use of at least 176 plant species with medicinal properties used to treat gastrointestinal problems, cough, skin and veterinary uses. Approximately 12,000 people visit the park every year. The Baseline assessment conducted by COMPACT* in 2000 revealed that the main threats to the montane forest are: illegal hunting, honey gathering, commercial logging, fuel-wood collection, grass burning, commercial plantantions, and heavy visitor pressure. Most of these threats can be seen as illegal activities carried out by local people to earn a living.<BR>In response to this situation, the GEF COMPACT strategy in Tanzania is first of all to provide local residents with sustainable alternative livelihoods opportunities. To this end, between 2001 and 2004 COMPACT approved 14 projects that fall into four main categories: (i) environmental conservation awareness and education; (ii) small-scale irrigation farming and water supply projects to promote crop production; (iii) promotion of household energy farms and use of fuel-efficient stoves to reduce fuel-wood demand from the Mt.

Coral reefs do not have just and aesthetic value for Indonesia. Indeed, they play a key role as a vital source of food and marine toursim for approximately 67,500 coastal villages. Despite their importance, Indonesia’s coral reefs are under serious threat mainly from unsustainable fishing tecniques, overfishing, sedimentation and pollution. Urgent management interventions are therefore needed to protect Indonesia’s reefs. In response to this situation the Government of Indonesia (GOI) launched the Coral Reef Management Program (COREMAP) in 1998 as a 15-year program with the objectives of protecting and achieving sustainable use of coral reefs and associated ecosystems in Indonesia, whilst enhancing the welfare of coastal communities. The GEF project was designed as an adaptable program loan to this project. The strategy chosen to implement COREMAP is that of community-based management (CBM). This choice was based on the realization that Government agencies cannot effectively manage the extensive coral reef areas without the close involvement of coastal villages themselves. It was also realized that the CBM approach could not be successful without a supporting framework to contain external threats. To this end, the objective of the first phase of GEF's project was to strengthen the national policy, institutional capacity and legal framework for coral reef management. However, a review of the initial phase of the project revealed that it has so far been only modestly effective in establishing a viable framework for coral reef management in Indonesia.","The impact of the project on natural capital is likely to be positive, but its scale is impossible to establish due to lack of data.","The project's main achievement to date has been the creation of effective institutional capacity for coral reef management at the national, district and community level.

The coast and reef provide a habitat for numerous species of coral, reef fish, mammals and  resident and migratory birds. In 1996, the Belize Barrier Reef was declared a World Heritage Site. Belize’s main economic activities are agricultural cultivation and related processing; harvesting of forestry products; harvesting and production of marine products; and tourism. These activities are often carried out in a unsustainable way and, as a consequence, all protected areas in Belize are facing increasing pressures from a number of sources. On the marine front, both commercial and residential development are leading to mangrove destruction, dredging, erosion and silting. In addition, fishing and tourism are particularly significant impactors on the marine environment.<BR>The Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Belize Barrier Reef Complex Project was set up in response to the many threats posed to the the country's coastal zone by economic activites in general, and by the expansion of Belize’s coastal population and by a massive increase in visitor numbers in particular. The Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Belize Barrier Reef Complex project builds on a broad range of previous and current UNDP and GEF assistance to Belize, starting in 1990 when a Coastal Zone Management Unit was established and made operational under the Department of Fisheries. The unit’s activities were funded by the GEF in 1993. Following the success of this five-year pilot programme, further funding was granted by the GEF, resulting in the Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Belize Barrier Reef Complex project. The project, which spans five years (1999-2004), seeks primarily to protect the country’s natural resources through research, policy formulation and the sustainable management of some designated areas. In terms of local benefits, the project aims to improve community involvement in planning and management of conservation area and to develop alternative livelihoods. However, it should be noted at the outset that many of the project’s activities were at the policy and institutional level. Their intention (which in large measure has been accomplished) was to create an enabling environment through which coastal resources could be protected. Sustainability of project activities and strengthening of human and institutional capacities were identified by the project as key activities for its success.","There were few demonstrated improvements in local access to marine resources as a result of the creation of the network of the Marine Protected Areas. However, there are potentials for improvement where effective management leads to long-term improvements to fish stocks.","Many people have moved from fishing, towards tourism-related activities. However, this increase in sustainable livelihoods opportunities would have probably happened in any case. The project clearly demonstrated improvements to physical capital, with five MPA ranger stations built and furnished and MPAs equipped with boats, engines and dive equipment. At least 30 people in 3 Coastal Advisory Committees were trained in leadership and conflict resolution skills; additionally, at least 10 rangers were trained in enforcement duties and boat and engine maintenance.

These activities are often carried out in an unsustainable way and, as a consequence, all protected areas in Belize are facing increasing pressures from a number of sources.

The Community Co-Managed Park System for Belize Project’s was carried out between 1999 and 2002. On a general basis, the project aimed to strengthen and solidify the co-management structure in existing parks, expand the network of co-managed parks, create a model for a new type of protected area for private-public lands, and improve the capacity of the Government to implement sustainable human development initiatives in effective support of the natural resources conservation initiatives of the country. <BR>The project’s original concept focused on four protected areas as pilots, with the intention of expanding the model to additional parks and protected areas before the project’s completion. The four areas selected were: Five Blues Lake National Park, Manatee Forest Reserve, Freshwater Creek Forest Reserve and Aguacaliente Wildlife Sanctuary. However, the project has largerly failed to achieve its goals, mainly due to flaws in the basic concepts upon which the project's design was based.

The overall development objective of the NRMP is to protect, rehabilitate and sustainably manage national land, forest, savanna woodlands and wildlife resources and to sustainably increase the income of rural communities who own these resources. Specifically, the development objective of the Phase 1 of the project is to establish effective policy and institutional frameworks for sustainable resources management programmes, among which is the implementation of the Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas (GSBAs). In order to achieve its objectives, the project main strategy at the community level is to ensure the active participation of the local people in the conservation, protection and management of the GSBAs. To this end two main approaches have been adopted: formation of the Community Biodiversity Advisory Groups (CBAGAs), to enhance community involvement in the management of the GSBAs, and development of alternative livelihoods through the provision of financial support to communities whose livelihoods depend on the forest. <BR>Two communities, Sagyemase and Jema, were studied to assess the type and scale of benefits (as well as the negative impacts) that resulted from the first phase of the project. These communities are located in the high forest zone of Ghana, where the vegatation is composed by a mixed patches of secondary forests, crop lands and fallow areas. Farming is the dominant activity in the study communities, involving the cultivation of food and cash crops as well as animal rearing, especially poultry. In both communities, off- reserves forests had reduced significantly in the years before the implementation of the project due mainly to logging and increased demand of such lands for the cultivation of cocoa and other tree crops including citrus and oil palm.<BR>One of the main conclusion of the study is that local people are aware that the GSBAs will give them benefits in the long run but in the short term there are several costs that they will have to sustain, especially the loss of access to some resources in the forest reserves, particularly land for farming and community expansion and development. Consequently, they expect to be compensated particularly through the support of sustainable alternative livelihoods.","In general the project has led to the following:<BR>- Reduced illegal activities in the forest reserves (and therefore reduced litigation arising from encroachment of forest resources)<BR>- Community members have become more aware of their rights and responsibilities in the management of the forest reserves<BR>- The good maintenance of the forest and reduced illegal logging in off reserve forests lands were cited as major contributory factors to the improvement in the local weather conditions","In general the project has led to the following:<BR>- In terms of physical infrastructure, the project has not set up any yet; however the communities expect the project to provide numerous facilities<BR>- Members of the CBAGs have been given various forms of training in conservation, protection and management of the GSBAs, and are expected to impart the knowledge gained to other members of their communities.

Through its support, GEF has helped the country build and solidify the SNAP, with the two-fold aim of achieving global environmental goals and improving the lives of local communities. In particular, the GEF has directed its support toward specific components that are fundamental for the SNAP’s organization and consolidation: conserve priority representative ecosystems of great importance for biodiversity conservation in Bolivia; develop conceptual, policy, and institutional frameworks for management of the SNAP and of individual protected areas; lay foundations for sustainable natural resources management as an economic and social development alternative for communities in and around protected areas; generate sustainable financing mechanisms. <BR>In terms of the above mentioned objectives, GEF I and GEF II have achieved some impressive results, contributing to local and global benefits that go well beyond the pursuit of biodiversity conservation.

At the same time, Upper Mustang is a predominanlty barren land, inhabited by a very scarse and sparse population who is very dependent on the natural resource base (which includes water, rangelands, soil, scrub and forest). Decreasing availability of some of the natural resources has therefore been reported as an issue by many households. This negative trend can be explained by a number of causes: changing patterns of animal husbandry by local pastoralists and nomads leading to increased conflict between livestock and wildlife; greater grazing pressure on rangelands; over-exploitation of shrub lands and remaining forested areas for fuel wood; and inadequately planned activities, particularly commercial ventures that are expected, as a result of anticipated changes in tourism policy.<BR>In response to this situation, the Upper Mustang Biodiversity Conservation Project (UMBCP), a community-based integrated biodiversity conservation project, was launched in 2000 (and is due to be completed in 2006).

More specifically, the objectives of the project are: to build institutional capacity for effective protected area management and biodiversity conservation; to develop through research and data collection a base of essential biodiversity related information in Upper Mustang; to undertake livelihood initiatives through local partnerships (e.g. afforestation, improved pasture management, rehabilitation of degraded rangelands). <BR>The project has been able to generate some benefits related to the environment which may be considered to be not only local, but also globally relevant. The most important of these is the knowledge generated by research and documentation of a unique and critically threatened ecosystem. Moreover, the conservation of art and architecture within and outside of Gompas and Stupas has provided employment and encouraged tourism and helped immensely in reviving cultural pride.","The project has contributed to improving natural capital. In particular, the project has supported the plantation of 306,524 trees while wildlife numbers have increased over the life of the project. However, the activities implemented so far have had more a development, than a conservation focus.","The following are some of UMBCP impacts to date:<BR>- Overall UMBCP has made modest progress on improving livelihoods through income and employment, despite the establishment of 20 saving and credit groups. Approximately 25-30 youths (women and men) have received training in restoration and are now employed by the AHF on a seasonal basis<BR>- Tourism has been identified as an important source of livelihood, but some critical issues related to tourism revenue sharing have not been solved yet<BR>- The project has made a positive and significant impact on social and institutional capital in terms of increased participation of women and cultural heritage conservation<BR>- UMBCP has carried out a significant amount of technical training, awareness raising and conservation education activities (33 different training courses for 1869 project staff and community members)<BR>- UMBCP has contributed significantly to improvements in physical capital for local communities (e.g. construction of road and suspension bridges;

However, only in the early 1990s did the Government of Tanaznia recognize it as ‘biodiversity hot-spot’. The global environmental goal of Jozani-Chwaka Bay Conservation Project (JCBCP) is to conserve the biodiversity of Jozani Forest and Chwaka Bay, which contains areas of coastal swamp and coral rag forest that are unique as well as important areas of mangrove forest. More specifically, the goals identified by the project were: i) to protect and sustainably utilize the biodiversity of the Jozani Chwaka Bay; ii) to enhance the livelihood security of communities adjacent to Jozani Chwaka Bay. These mutually reinforcing goals were chosen based on the hypothesis that increased household savings and income will reduce pressure on natural resources and lead to the sustainable conservation of biodiversity, in the context of strong and environmentally aware community and government institutions.<BR>The GEF-UNDP component of the project focused on biodiversity conservation through Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM), strengthening the communities’ natural resources and community organizations, training and infra-structure development. The Government of Tanzania, CARE, the Ford Foundation and McKnight Foundation focused on income generating activities (IGAs). The project, which began implementation in 2000 and was completed in mid 2003, has generated significant local livelihood benefits.","Natural capital in the JCBCA has improved, as evidenced by the marked increase in number of various wildlife populations, coupled with halt in encroachments into the JCBCA. The conservation area was also successfully gazetted as a National Park in 2004. Improvements in community access to natural capital were evidenced also by increased access to ground water, woodfuel and building materials through agro-forestry.","The project has enabled opportunities for alternative livelihood activities in areas such as improved farming (mushroom growing), mariculture, agroforestry and ecotourism, which in turn has lead to increases in cash incomes and improvements to the ability to save and access capital. Social and institutional capital improvements were evidenced in development of community-level institutions, most notably the savings and credit groups.

The project is based on the priorities identified in the National Environmental Action Plan and the National Biodiversity Strategy, and is consequently strongly rooted in the wider conservation policy context of the Government of Yemen. Both of these policy frameworks identified the protection of unique forest ecosystems in arid and semi-arid mountainous areas as key priorities. <BR>The overall project objective is to conserve biodiversity of global significance in Yemen through the protection, maintenance and enhancement of forest ecosystems in arid and semi-arid mountainous areas by promoting sustainable, community-based management of two selected forest ecosystems and by developing replicable systems for preserving biodiversity in Yemen.

The TAL in Nepal is important for economic reasons, as well as for its biodiversity and ecological services. The highly productive alluvial grasslands and subtropical forests support some of the highest densities in the world of the Royal Bengal tiger, as well as numerous species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The Terai Arc Landscape in Nepal also hosts a dense and rapidly growing human popualtion, the majority of whom are poor farmers. These rural households depend heavily on natural resources for their subsistence. As a consequence, poaching of wildlife and illegal timber extraction are posing a major threat to the region biodiversity.<BR>WWF began working in Nepal in the 1960s with a very species-focused approach. Today, WWF is integrating the Sustainable Livelihoods framework into its species conservation approach. Within this approach, one of WWF main strategy has been to support the formation of User Groups who are assigned clear-cut rights and responsibilities for the management of their forests. Other activities carried out by WWF in TAL, in order to achieve both conservation and livelihoods objectives, include: i) developing nature-based tourism, to provide local communities bordering protected areas an alternative source of income; ii) strengthening capacity building; iii) developing basic infrastructures, like schools, roads, bridges, irrigation schemes, etc.; iv) promoting the development of sustainable income generating opportunities, through the provision of training, equipment and small credit schemes.","Today, over 18% of Nepal is under protected area status and the pressure on wildlife habitat within protected areas have been greatly reduced, as proved by the growing numbers of tigers and rhinos. The adoption of improved stoves and the use of biogas reactors and toilets lead to a cleaner environment and better health. Each reactor also helps saving about 3000kg of firewood and 40 litres of kerosene annually. Forest restoration activities carried out by the User Groups include seedling production, plantation and natural regeneration under sustainable management regimes. Finally, the TAL Programme has initiated the cleaning and restoration of ponds within a number of community forests.","Nature-based tourism initiatives have provided local communities bordering protected areas with substantial financial and employment benefits.

Vegetation in Caprivi consists mostly of Kalahari teak woodland, riverine woodland and floodplains. The soils are generally poor, consisting mostly of Kalahari sand from the riverine floodplains. Wildlife associated with the various vegetation types is present, though scarce. The economy of the region is predominantly rural and subsistence-led. Most people, especially the poorest groups, are directly dependent on natural resources for a variety of livelihood activities. Wildlife in particular provides both food and, to a lesser extent, income security. As a consequence, wildlife in Caprivi has often been threatened with over-exploitation.<BR>In response to this situation, the government of Namibia launched the National Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) Programme, a joint venture between government, non-governmental agencies and local communities, which aims to achieve both sustainable natural resource management and socio-economic development in Namibia. WWF has helped to develop the CBNRM approach in the Caprivi region, by supporting the Namibian NGO Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC). In the Caprivi region, the project operates in the Bwabwata National Park, in Eastern Caprivi, and on the eastern floodplains. The main strategy used by IRDNC was to promote the formation of conservancies (community based resource management committees), whom, under Namibian laws, are able to benefit from wildlife, both for consumptive and non-consumptive uses. Rights granted to the conservancies include the rights of ownership over huntable game, revenue from the sale of game, and game products and tourism.<BR>Five conservancies were registered in Caprivi through IRDNC support and are currently benefiting in a number of important ways.","IRDNC’s CBNRM approach has contributed to the protection and recovery of wildlife species, and improved wildlife management practices, as proved by the increase in wildlife numbers in key areas and by wildlife returning to areas from which it had disappeared. However, illegal hunting for household use and for income continues to take place, though at a greatly reduced pace.","Rural communities in Caprivi are currently benefiting from the CBNRM programme in a number of important ways: tourism lodges and campsites, built in the course of the project, have become the major source of income and employment (199 full-time and 46 part-time jobs) for the conservancies; 12 craft groups have been formed and training provided to improve skills and entrepreneurship, whilst two craft markets were developed where the products can be sold; social empowerment of marginalized rural people, especially women, was achieved; wildlife conservation is contributing to achieving good governance through rural empowerment.","PP|PA|","http://www.worldwildlife.org/pubs/wwfmdgreport2006final.pdf",,,".  community based natural resource management cbnrm programme in caprivi namibia integrated rural development and nature conservation irdnc wwf caprivi region species rural communities conserve the wildlife of the caprivi region promote a sustainable socio economic development of the caprivi region the caprivi region one of the poorest and least developed regions in namibia has a population of approximately 79 852 inhabiting an area of 20 009sqkm vegetation in caprivi consists mostly of kalahari teak woodland riverine woodland and floodplains the soils are generally poor consisting mostly of kalahari sand from the riverine floodplains wildlife associated with the various vegetation types is present though scarce the economy of the region is predominantly rural and subsistence led most people especially the poorest groups are directly dependent on natural resources for a variety of livelihood activities wildlife in particular provides both food and to a lesser extent income security as a consequence wildlife in caprivi has often been threatened with over exploitation in response to this situation the government of namibia launched the national community based natural resource management cbnrm programme a joint venture between government non governmental agencies and local communities which aims to achieve both sustainable natural resource management and socio economic development in namibia wwf has helped to develop the cbnrm approach in the caprivi region by supporting the namibian ngo integrated rural development and nature conservation irdnc in the caprivi region the project operates in the bwabwata national park in eastern caprivi and on the eastern floodplains the main strategy used by irdnc was to promote the formation of conservancies community based resource management committees whom under namibian laws are able to benefit from wildlife both for consumptive and non consumptive uses rights granted to the conservancies include the rights of ownership over huntable game revenue from the sale of game and game products and tourism five conservancies were registered in caprivi through irdnc support and are currently benefiting in a number of important ways irdnc’s cbnrm approach has contributed to the protection and recovery of wildlife species and improved wildlife management practices as proved by the increase in wildlife numbers in key areas and by wildlife returning to areas from which it had disappeared however illegal hunting for household use and for income continues to take place though at a greatly reduced pace rural communities in caprivi are currently benefiting from the cbnrm programme in a number of important ways tourism lodges and campsites built in the course of the project have become the major source of income and employment 199 full time and 46 part time jobs for the conservancies; 12 craft groups have been formed and training provided to improve skills and entrepreneurship whilst two craft markets were developed where the products can be sold; social empowerment of marginalized rural people especially women was achieved; wildlife conservation is contributing to achieving good governance through rural empowerment  .",,,NULL,NULL

Bwindi hosts at least twelve species known to be threatened with global extinction, including the critically endangered mountain gorilla, while its forest has various ecological values including soil conservation, water catchment, and biodiversity. The rural areas around the parks are among the most densely populated areas in Africa. Agriculture is the main economic activity of the largely poor, rural communities around Bwindi, and fuelwood is the main source of energy for cooking. As a consequence, agriculture encroachment, poaching and illegal exploitation of the forest's resources have often occured in Bwindi, even after it was gazetted a national park in 1991. <BR>To address this situation WWF, in partnership with African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI), launched the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP), with the aim of identifying environment-livelihood linkages to generate dual benefits for conservation and rural communities. The main strategy adopted by IGCP to achieve its objectives was to develop a Collaborative Forest Management (CFM) approach through the creation of Multiple Use Zones (MUZ). Through this mechanism, locals were given: access to the forests for collection of NTFPs, and the placement of hives for beekeeping; employment and responsibility to help park managers in their duties; employment and income from gorilla tourism. <BR>A recent socio-economic study reported that over 60 per cent of people in most communities bordering protected areas felt that they benefited from the project. One of the benefits is the development of a strong cooperation between the various agencies in the area and the local community.","The massive destruction of forests through illegal clearing and unsustainable practices have been greatly reduced and even halted in critical areas. Degradation of the environment has stopped, and signs of regeneration are visible in some patches.

Beside the giant panda, these areas are very rich in biodiversity, and play a crucial role in providing fuelwood and freshwater for local people. Farming and animal husbandry are the dominant occupations for the abundant, and largely poor, human population living in the Minshan and Qinling mountains. Local people have always been heavily dependent on the extraction of forest resources for their livelihoods, sometimes causing heavy deforestation through their activities. Recognizing how critical the mountains were as catchment areas for farmland irrigation and for drinking water to millions of people downstream, the Chinese government included these areas in the 1998 logging ban imposed in several provinces. This led to the loss of the chief source of income in a region where poverty remains entrenched, and, therefore, to illegal logging and poaching. <BR>Recognizing that, without responding to the livelihood needs of the impoverished farming communities, the giant panda and its habitat, could not be protected, WWF has launched various projects in China (e.g. Pingwu Integrated Conservation and Development Project (ICDP); Minshan Landscape Initiative; Qinling Panda Focal Project) aimed at pursuing both conservation and livelihoods goals. The main strategies adopted by WWF in these projects are: i) to develop models of innovation and partnerships between local communities, government and the private sector; ii) to build local capacities to follow sustainable and viable livelihood options.<BR>Many benefits have already been delivered in the Minshan and Qinling mountains in China as a result of WWF's interventions.","There are some indicators that large-scale logging and deforestation have halted and a slow recovery is taking place, also thanks to the adoption of energy efficient stoves that consume 30% less fuelwood than the traditional stoves. Overall, the government has established 33 panda reserves that provide protection for over 60% of the country’s giant panda populations. Surveys confirm that the panda population is slowly but steadily increasing. One negative impact on conservation has derived from unplanned, large-scale tourism, which is causing pollution and exploitation of natural resources.","One of the main achievement of WWF's projects was to provide local people with alternative livelihoods opportunities, through the provision of training, equipment and small grants. In particular, WWF has supported: 80 farmers to begin beekeeping; 57 farmers to start raising goats and pigs; 235 farmers to cultivate non-timber forest products (NTFPs), such as apple trees, walnut and prickly ash pepper plants; 102 farmers to cultivate medicinal herbs; 185 farmers to start or expand their vegetable plots.

Tortuguero National Park consists of very humid tropical forests and wetlands, and is most famous for the beach that hosts nest sites for four sea turtle species: green, leatherback, hawksbill, and loggerhead. All four species are classified as endangered or critically endangered. In addition, the national park hosts 55 species of fishes, over 350 species of birds, and 140 species of mammals. Historically, the main economic activity in Tortuguero, a community of few hundreads individuals, was the exploitation of meat and eggs from the area’s nesting green turtles. With the creation of Tortuguero National Park in 1970, many of the natural resources traditionally used by people became off-limits. As a result, the local residents’ standards of living declined in the decade after the park’s creation, until tourism began to grow in the mid 1980s.<BR>A range of organisations have supported local people's efforts to develop tourism in Tortuguero, such as: Caribbean Conservation Corporation (CCC), which has undertaken sea turtle research and conservation efforts in Tortuguero since 1959, the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), the National Learning Institute, and the Costa Rican Tourism Institute. To date, the economic benefits of sea turtle conservation in Tortuguero are clear, while education and health services have improved only marginally. Increased job opportunities and incomes have contributed to increased standard of living for Tortuguero residents, but tourism has also contributed to problems like increased solid waste and sewage production, and a rise in drug and alcohol abuse.","Conservation efforts at Tortuguero have contributed to an estimated increase by 417% in green turtle nesting between 1971-2003. Green turtles in turn help to maintain sea grass beds and make them more productive. However, deforestation in a 10km buffer zone outside the park increased during the same time period. In addition, increased human population and visitation has resulted in a large increase in solid waste and sewage.","Tourism to watch nesting sea turtles and other wildlife in Tortuguero National Park increased from 226 visitors in 1980 to 80,319 visitors in 2004, generating vast income and employment opportunites (the number of jobs generated by tourism can be estimated at 359, with 235 tour guides licensed to conduct sea turtle tours).

Over the last two decades, the increasing degradation of the River Basin, together with unsustainable fishing, has negatively affected both the dolphin population and human communities living in the basin. WWF India, recognizing the Ganges River dolphin as a species of particular concern, launched in 2001 the Ganges River Dolphin Conservation Initiative in Farida village as a pilot programme to improve the livelihoods of the local community, improve the conservation status of the river dolphins in the area, and influence government policies on conservation. More specifically, the project aimed at: improving water quality through the minimization of chemical fertilizer and pesticide use; improving afforestation; introducing innovative methods to reduce fuelwood use; introducing education and awareness raising programmes, and capacity building within the community to achieve sustainable livelihoods.<BR>The WWF programme has resulted in improved livelihood assets of the inhabitants of Farida village, which is in turn benefiting both the villagers and the natural environment in which they live. The whole process was also instrumental in building capacity within the local governmental institutions.","As a result of WWF project: replanting schemes were carried out in selected sites along the banks of the river; the use of wood as the fuel for cooking declined from 37% to 14%; the percentage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides used by each household was reduced from 81% to 51%, while the percentage of organic fertilizers and pesticides used by each household increased from 19% to 49%. Finally, these improvements have had a positive impact on the dolphin population in the area. Dolphin sightings in the section of the Ganges near Farida are far more common than before. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, the number of dolphins has doubled to 40 over a ten-year period.","The programme worked with various government agencies to facilitate the training of villagers to set up cottage and small-scale enterprises and assist them in securing financial support from banks and cooperative societies. As a result, the majority of villagers stopped commercial fishing activities and have started to participate in alternative livelihoods that provide them with better economic benefits than fishing.

This strategy was mainly based on the creation of a non profit conservation association which would take over many of the duties normally carried out by the Government bodies. Thus, in 1990 the organisation PRONATURA was established.

More specifically, the project included the following components: 1) construction of a new pumping complex in Yuncheng and provision of 14 floating pumps at the existing station at Zuncun; 2) improvement and expansion of Yuncheng irrigation system; 3) river beach development; 4) construction of village water supplies in Yuncheng and Luliang; 5) improvement of existing rural roads; 6) soil and water conservation works in Luliang; 7) expansion of horticulture; 8) expansion of livestock raising by individual farmers; 9) expansion and improvement of agricultural processing facilities; 10) support of the All China Women's Federation (ACWF); and 11) facilities for project management and training.","The environmental interventions undertaken in the Shanxi province have resulted in substantial watershed and irrigation improvements, which in turn have led to increases in crop yields, and expansion of livestock and horticulture.","In the period between 1995 and 1999, per capita incomes increased from 620 yuan to 1377 yuan in villages involved in the irrigation component of the project, and from 468 to 699 yuan in villages involved in the rehabilitation component of the project. In contrast, per capita incomes in non-project villages declined to 354 yuan, even though they had been slightly higher than project village incomes at the beginning. Overall, it is estimated that the number of households living below the poverty line fell from 14.84% to 8.9% of the population between 1995 and 1999. Finally, significant improvements in nutritional levels were witnessed in project villages between 1995 and 2000.","PG|NR|","http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228424&Projectid=P003649","Bass, S., Reid, H., Satterthwaite, D., and Steele, P., 2005, \"Reducing Poverty and Sustaining the Environment: The Politics of Local Engagement\", Earthscan, London",,".  shanxi poverty alleviation project china world bank international development association ida yuncheng and luliang prefectures in shanxi province ecosystem landscape local communities promote a more sustainable use of natural resources raise incomes for about 3 million poor people living in yuncheng and luliang prefectures in shanxi province the shanxi poverty alleviation project was implemented by the world bank in shanxi province north central china from 1996 to 2001 the project s main objective was to alleviate poverty in the 20 poorest counties of yuncheng and luliang prefectures in shanxi province in order to achieve its objective the project included a range of activities like rehabilitation of an existing irrigation system improvements of rural roads and construction of village water supplies land development expansion of livestock raising and horticulture and expansion of primary agricultural processing capacity more specifically the project included the following components 1 construction of a new pumping complex in yuncheng and provision of 14 floating pumps at the existing station at zuncun; 2 improvement and expansion of yuncheng irrigation system; 3 river beach development; 4 construction of village water supplies in yuncheng and luliang; 5 improvement of existing rural roads; 6 soil and water conservation works in luliang; 7 expansion of horticulture; 8 expansion of livestock raising by individual farmers; 9 expansion and improvement of agricultural processing facilities; 10 support of the all china women s federation acwf ; and 11 facilities for project management and training the environmental interventions undertaken in the shanxi province have resulted in substantial watershed and irrigation improvements which in turn have led to increases in crop yields and expansion of livestock and horticulture in the period between 1995 and 1999 per capita incomes increased from 620 yuan to 1377 yuan in villages involved in the irrigation component of the project and from 468 to 699 yuan in villages involved in the rehabilitation component of the project in contrast per capita incomes in non project villages declined to 354 yuan even though they had been slightly higher than project village incomes at the beginning overall it is estimated that the number of households living below the poverty line fell from 14 84% to 8 9% of the population between 1995 and 1999 finally significant improvements in nutritional levels were witnessed in project villages between 1995 and 2000  .",,,NULL,NULL

They also intensify the impact of fires and floods and increase soil erosion. In response to this situation, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry launched in 1995 the Working for Water (WfW) programme. This programme was developed with the dual objective of controlling alien invasive plants and providing training and job opportunities for poor people. The concept of combating environmental degradation while providing economic activity in depressed rural areas was very well received and quickly gained the support of government, private sector, and non-governmental organisations. <BR>WfW currently runs over 300 projects in all nine of South Africa’s provinces. Scientists and field workers use a range of methods to control invasive alien plants. These include: 1) mechanical methods (felling, removing or burning invading alien plants); 2) chemical methods (using environmentally safe herbicides); 3) biological control (using species-specific insects and diseases from the alien plant’s country of origin). WfW also considers the development of people as an essential element of the project. Short-term jobs created through the clearing activities are undertaken, with the emphasis on endeavouring to recruite women (the target is 60%), youth (20%) and disabled (5%). <BR>The programme is globally recognised as one of the most outstanding environmental conservation initiatives on the continent. It enjoys sustained political support for its job creation efforts and the fight against poverty.","Since its inception, the programme has cleared more than one million hectares of invasive alien plants. The project also suceeded in raising the level of environmental knowledge and awareness in these areas, encouraging the sustainable use of natural resources.","Since its start, the programme has provided jobs and training to approximately 20.000 people from among the most marginalized sectors of society per annum. Of these, 52% are women, 26% youth, and 1% people with disabilities.

The project is led by Randall Borman, an American missionary’s son who grew up with the Cofan. In the 1980s Borman guided the migration of the Cofan to Zabalo, where they gained tribal ownership rights from the Ecuadorean government, and eventually won the right to manage their own resources. After that, the Cofan of Zabalo worked hard to protect their natural resources by, among other things, preventing overhunting, and allocating areas to be used for ecotourism within the no hunting zone. Until 1992, the Zabalo experience was exclusively sold through Borman to Wilderness Travel, a North American outbound tour operator. In 1992 Borman established a community company with ten Cofan community associates. All associates must work on the enterprise and, in return, they earn a percentage of the profits. The same year, Borman and his Cofan business partners entered into a joint venture with Transturi, called Aguarico Trekking, to give the Cofan a more dependable number of visitors.

The Huaorani people have inhabited the headwaters of the Amazon for millennia and have lived as hunters and gatherers, entirely without contact from outsiders right up until the end of the 1950's. Currently numbering approximately 1,200 individuals, they continue to maintain a largely traditional lifestyle, living from the rainforest. TROPIC Ecological Adventures approached the Huaorani in 1994, and under their complete control, developed a joint programme to bring visitors into the territory of one of their communities located on the upper Shiripuno river. TROPIC provided training on the practices of ecotourism, conservation, and management. A guest cabin was built about 45 minutes from the village, to avoid intrusion of village life. Huaorani guides accompany visitors and local canoe drivers must be employed. Cooks are trained to prepare meals for tourists. <BR>This project offers an interesting view of how ecotourism can help underwrite the minimal costs for education and communication required by an indigenous community that chooses to maintain a hunting and gathering existence, without necessarily bringing negative cultural and environmental effects.

Inhabitants of Torghar (approximately 4.000 people) are indigenous groups living since centuries in these mountains. The people of Torghar are semi-nomadic pastoralists and there are virtually no other sources of permanent or temporary employment in the Torghar Hills. As a result, Torghar society is marked by extreme poverty.<BR>This area has long been famous for its abundant and diverse wildlife, which has been hunted for a long time. As a consequence, by the early 1980s the Sulaiman markhor and Afghan urial populations were reduced to remnants, and leopards were almost extirpated from the region. This realization, led to the development at the community level of a plan to initiate a \"game guard\" programme at Torghar, to be funded through the proceeds generated by a limited, controlled trophy hunt of Afghan urial. Under this plan, the Torghar Hills were closed to all hunting and game guards selected from the local population were hired to enforce the ban. The program was stared in 1985 by seven game guards and continued to advance slowly as the years passed. In April 1994, the Torghar Conservation Project was converted into an NGO - the Society for Torghar Environmental Protection (STEP) - and registered in Balochistan. In 1996 GEF SGP decided to support this project by funding the following activities, some of which focused on environmental issues while some on alleviating poverty: a) construction of water tanks; b) construction of dam; c) lining of irrigation channels; d) building of terraced field for orchards; e) supply and plantation of fruit trees; f) expansion and clearing of springs; g) construction of new link roads; h) repair of old link roads; i) medical aid and medicines.","The water tanks and the dams built in the course of the project are a source of drinking water also for livestock and their construction has helped reduce the livestock population from core area thereby reducing competition with wildlife. Increased agricultural production from orchards has resulted in an increase in income which in turn is expected to reduce the sole reliance on livestock.","Cleaning of springs, construction of water tanks, and lining of irrigation channels resulted in increased water supply in the fields leading to increased agricultural production.

In turn, heavy dependency on forest resources for livelihoods is contributing to a rapid depletion of natural resources.<BR>In response to this situation the project 'Securing Rural Livelihood through Biodiversity Conservation' was launched in 2004 by the local NGO Jagriti, with the financial support of GEF SGP. The purpose of this project is to provide sustainable livelihood options to poor, rural mountain communities through biodiversity conservation. More specifically, the project intends to: 1) build the capacities of women in the area, also through the creation of Women’s Saving and Credit Groups; 2) train members in different income generation activities (oil extraction, vermin composting, raising of medicinal plants and herbs, etc.); 3) organize alternative income generating activities and expanding the scale of operations to obtain better prices for the products; 4) facilitate discussions and raise awareness on issues of deforestation, biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of local resources; 5) introduce LPG stoves and pressure cookers, to reduce the burden on women of firewood collection and to decrease forest dependency.","The following are some of the achievements of the project to date:<BR>- 1 nursery has been set up<BR>- 5 species of rare medicinal plants have been sown in the nursery and the women are committed to conserve and nurture the varieties, which were getting extinct and rare<BR>- 144 families decreased their use of chemical fertilizers, leading to an improvement of soil fertility","The following are some of the achievements of the project to date:<BR>- 2 quintals of apricot kernels were procured by the women, which fetched a rate of about $2 per kg.

The coral reefs, mangroves, lagoons, offshore islands and sea-grass beds are home to a wide number of plants and animals.

In particular, over-fishing is a major threat to the reef system as well as to the livelihood of the local communities. To counteract this situation, Blue Ventures, a UK-based NGO, launched in 2003 a conservation project in the region of Andavadoaka, aimed at improving the quality of life of the local community, whose economy is entirely based on fishing, whilst maintaining the biological diversity and productivity of the reefs. In order to achieve its objectives, the project set out to implement the following activities: 1) implementation and monitoring of a pilot no-take zone for the reef flat octopus fisheries; 2) conducting a marine and socio-economic research on the effects of the no-take zone; 3) developing eco-tourism as a supplementary source of income for the local community; 4) creating an “official” protected site and showcase Andavadoaka as a model for how protected areas can be managed by the local community and improve local livelihoods; 5) raising awareness and education on marine conservation, both locally and nationally.<BR>The first results achieved by the project suggest that this approach has the potential to increase the productivity and sustainability of octopus fisheries.

The diversity of this cropping system and its capacity to grow in infertile soil without demanding much water or external inputs, makes it uniquely important for the survival of ecologically sustainable agricultural systems. For these culturally rich, vibrant, self-reliant communities, the government’s neo-liberal economic policies, introduced since the year 2000, constitute a harsh intrusion. Moreover, the government move towards biotechnology was seen as negative both for food security and for environmental sustainability. In response to these policies, the women of the Deccan Development Society sanghams (village-level women’s collectives) decided to build an alternative public distribution system, through a community grain fund. This initiative was meant to resist the havoc over the dryland food system caused by the government-sponsored public distribution system (PDS), which was originally intended to provide essential foodgrain at subsided rates, but actually proved to be the death knell for dryland food-producing communities. To fight this attack on their traditional farming practices, the communities decided to institutionalise their own community-controlled local grain-based alternative public distribution (APDS) system. The APDS is dependent on local production, local storage and local distribution, which alone would ensure community autonomy over food production and consumption.","Traditional varieties of sorghum, millets and of other plants, which are adapted to dryland and semi-arid conditions, have been planted on 5,000 acres of land which had gone fallow.","- An extra 1.5 million kilograms of sorghum is produced every year <BR>- The fodder provided by the newly cultivated fields sustains over 10,000 head of cattle in 50 villages every year<BR>- In each village, 2,500 extra wages/year have been created<BR>- Dalit women have become the patrons of a system designed, controlled and managed by themselves, resulting in a massive status reversal","EA|PP|","http://www.infochangeindia.org/agenda7_06.jsp","http://www.iied.org/NR/agbioliv/ag_liv_projects/t5proj01.html","Michel Pimbert, Project Co-ordinator, IIED<BR>Email: michel.pimbert@iied.org<BR>P.V.
