PEN aims to explore the role that forests play in poverty alleviation through the systematic collection of socio-economic data in a variety of tropical ecosystems. PEN will do this by looking at several dimensions of the forest-poverty link: the role in rural livelihoods; the role for different groups; the role in different forest environments; the role in different institutional contexts; the role in different market contexts.","1. Global data set: 38 case studies in 25 countries, with more than 9000 households included. Detailed quarterly data on forest use and other socioeconomic variables, using a common questionnaire.<BR>2. Global-comparative analysis: The global analysis will explain how forests contribute to subsistence and cash income, asset building, security and welfare, and how different policies, management systems and market conditions affect forest use and livelihoods.<BR>3. Thematic in-depth studies: Each individual study will have its own focus, and will yield critical insights that go well beyond what one can get in the global analysis.<BR>4. Policy analysis: The individual studies and the global syntheses will be designed to produce concrete recommendations that can be fed into policy processes at national and international levels.<BR>5. Improved methodologies and capacity building: A manual with tested questionnaires and research guidelines and have been developed, A methods book ?Measuring Livelihoods and Environmental Dependence? will be published by Earthscan in early 2011. Most of the PEN partners are PhD students from developing countries. The PEN experience will also feed into the survey work undertaken by FAO and the World Bank.<BR>As of August 2010, data collection is completed, the global data set is under construction, and some preliminary analyses have been undertaken. A major international conference will be held in June 2011 in London. The project will last until 2011/12.

The core focus of PEI is to support country-led efforts to integrate the environmental concerns of poor and vulnerable groups into policy and planning processes for poverty reduction and pro-poor growth. With both financial and technical support, UNDP and UNEP assist government decision-makers and a wide range of other stakeholders to manage the environment in a way that improves livelihoods and leads to sustainable growth. The PEI works with key government partners to raise awareness, influence policymaking and strengthen the mainstreaming of poverty-environment into budget processes, sector programmes and sub-national planning. The overall aim is to bring about lasting institutional change and to catalyse key actors to increase investment in pro-poor environmental and natural resource management.","The UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment Initiative has jointly supported the implementation of country level mainstreaming programmes in nine countries in Africa and two countries in Asia and the Pacific with the aim of increasing the capacity of governments to mainstream environment into national development processes and their implementation. Although all country programmes are similar in that they all employ the three-phased approach with the aim of developing a sustainable poverty-environment mainstreaming programme, each country programme is tailored to the specific needs and conditions of that country. Therefore the time-frame and the activities carried out under each programme can vary from country to country. <BR>The scale-up of the PEI is focused on building on the strengths of the current country programmes on a regional basis. In Africa, the PEI is aiming to add several more countries to the regional programme in the coming few years. Support to PEI country programmes is provided through the regional structures of UNDP and UNEP. <BR>As of 2010, the PEI is supporting programmes in 22 countries.<BR>PEI has had a long running involvement in great ape conservation and poverty reduction projects in Africa:<BR>?	PEI completed its first phase (mainstreaming environment into the PRSP) in Rwanda in 2007. The current focus is on capacity building at all levels of government. PEI in general is not considered to focus much on biodiversity, but in the Rwandan case there is considerable attention to this issue, particularly through mountain gorillas and tourism. <BR>?	Following successful integration of environmental issues into the PRSP, the current phase of PEI in Tanzania is focussed on capacity building, improving access to and utilisation of poverty-environment data and financing environmental targets in the Mkukuta PRSP. <BR>?	The overall objective of the PEI in Uganda is to integrate environmental concerns into policies, plans, programmes and budgeting processes both at local and national levels. Its specific objectives include raising awareness on the poverty-environmental linkages and bringing the linkages into development policies and poverty reduction strategies.","02--|019--|142--|150-151-|","200500","0","Victoria Luque	<BR>E-mail: victoria.luque@unep.org","http://www.unpei.org",".  undp unep poverty environment initiative in 2005 undp and unep formed a global partnership and merged their poverty environment programmes into one integrated programme the undp unep poverty and environment initiative pei the core focus of pei is to support country led efforts to integrate the environmental concerns of poor and vulnerable groups into policy and planning processes for poverty reduction and pro poor growth with both financial and technical support undp and unep assist government decision makers and a wide range of other stakeholders to manage the environment in a way that improves livelihoods and leads to sustainable growth the pei works with key government partners to raise awareness influence policymaking and strengthen the mainstreaming of poverty environment into budget processes sector programmes and sub national planning the overall aim is to bring about lasting institutional change and to catalyse key actors to increase investment in pro poor environmental and natural resource management the undp unep poverty environment initiative has jointly supported the implementation of country level mainstreaming programmes in nine countries in africa and two countries in asia and the pacific with the aim of increasing the capacity of governments to mainstream environment into national development processes and their implementation although all country programmes are similar in that they all employ the three phased approach with the aim of developing a sustainable poverty environment mainstreaming programme each country programme is tailored to the specific needs and conditions of that country therefore the time frame and the activities carried out under each programme can vary from country to country the scale up of the pei is focused on building on the strengths of the current country programmes on a regional basis in africa the pei is aiming to add several more countries to the regional programme in the coming few years support to pei country programmes is provided through the regional structures of undp and unep as of 2010 the pei is supporting programmes in 22 countries pei has had a long running involvement in great ape conservation and poverty reduction projects in africa ?	pei completed its first phase mainstreaming environment into the prsp in rwanda in 2007 the current focus is on capacity building at all levels of government pei in general is not considered to focus much on biodiversity but in the rwandan case there is considerable attention to this issue particularly through mountain gorillas and tourism ?	following successful integration of environmental issues into the prsp the current phase of pei in tanzania is focussed on capacity building improving access to and utilisation of poverty environment data and financing environmental targets in the mkukuta prsp ?	the overall objective of the pei in uganda is to integrate environmental concerns into policies plans programmes and budgeting processes both at local and national levels its specific objectives include raising awareness on the poverty environmental linkages and bringing the linkages into development policies and poverty reduction strategies victoria luque	 e mail victoria luque unep org  .",,,"D0210|D0034","Linking Poverty to Environmental Sustainability|UNDP/UNEP Poverty and Environment Initiative"
