As with other programming sectors, CARE applies a rights-based approach which addresses the underlying causes of poverty, environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity through focusing on issues of governance and underlying power relationships.<BR>CARE has had a long running involvement in great ape conservation and poverty reduction projects in Africa. From 1988 to 2002 it ran the Development Through Conservation project, which was an ICDP working in the parishes neighbouring Bwindi Impenetrable NP, home to both mountain gorillas and eastern chimpanzees. Interventions included support for an agricultural programme, the establishment of multiple-use zones within the park, and a resource substitution programme that supported on-farm woodlots to reduce demand for fuelwood and timber from the NP. These interventions had a generally positive impact on relations between local people and the NP, but a relatively limited impact on levels of poverty, mostly due to the scale of poverty in an area that is very densely populated. More recently, CARE has established a project called “Enterprise, Environment and Equity in the Virunga Landscape of the Great Lakes Region (EEEGL)”. The project seeks to link the conservation of protected areas with the development of the neighbouring rural region. This link is based on the economic benefits of protected areas (sustainable management of natural resources and tourism). It also seeks to link conservation (within and outside protected areas) to mainstream development processes, such as local and regional level development planning, regional transboundary collaboration, development of agriculture market linkages and the growth of the role of civil society in each country.","002--|019--|142--|150-151-|","Phil Franks, CARE Poverty and Environment Network Coordinator<BR>E-mail: pfranks@careclimatechange.org","http://www.care-international.org/",".  care international care international secretariat chemin de balexert 7 9 ch 1219 chatelaine geneva switzerland phone 41 22 795 10 20 fax 41 22 795 10 29 150 155 756 care is an international relief and development organisation that operates in more than 70 countries in africa asia latin america the middle east and eastern europe care international’s mission is to serve individuals and families in the poorest communities in the world to fulfil this mission care international pursues four inter connected lines of activity •	development and rehabilitation programming that addresses the underlying causes of poverty and social injustice; •	emergency response programming that provides rapid and effective support to victims of disasters; •	influencing policy development and implementation at all levels to make significant positive changes in the lives of poor people and communities; •	building diverse constituencies that support care international’s vision and mission in all countries where it works within its natural resources management nrm sector care has around 35 projects and programmes in 25 different countries which are focused on promoting sustainable nrm and conservation with social justice and equity as with other programming sectors care applies a rights based approach which addresses the underlying causes of poverty environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity through focusing on issues of governance and underlying power relationships care has had a long running involvement in great ape conservation and poverty reduction projects in africa from 1988 to 2002 it ran the development through conservation project which was an icdp working in the parishes neighbouring bwindi impenetrable np home to both mountain gorillas and eastern chimpanzees interventions included support for an agricultural programme the establishment of multiple use zones within the park and a resource substitution programme that supported on farm woodlots to reduce demand for fuelwood and timber from the np these interventions had a generally positive impact on relations between local people and the np but a relatively limited impact on levels of poverty mostly due to the scale of poverty in an area that is very densely populated more recently care has established a project called “enterprise environment and equity in the virunga landscape of the great lakes region eeegl ” the project seeks to link the conservation of protected areas with the development of the neighbouring rural region this link is based on the economic benefits of protected areas sustainable management of natural resources and tourism it also seeks to link conservation within and outside protected areas to mainstream development processes such as local and regional level development planning regional transboundary collaboration development of agriculture market linkages and the growth of the role of civil society in each country phil franks care poverty and environment network coordinator e mail pfranks careclimatechange org  .",,,"Alessandra Giuliani","2010-12-06 10:52:12"

Managing the trade-offs between conservation and development at the landscape scale is one of CIFOR’s six research “domains”, the goal of which is to shift policy and practice toward conservation and development approaches that are more effective, efficient and equitable in process and outcome. The research is intended to improve the conservation modalities of international conservation organisations and donor agencies, and to help foster land use allocation practices that better incorporate non market values, productive potential and local subsistence uses of forest resources. www.cifor.cgiar.org/Research/Themes/Theme4/theme_4.htm<BR>2. Improving livelihoods through smallholder and community forestry: Forest-based activities provide 30 million informal jobs in developing countries, as well as 13 to 35 percent of all rural nonfarm employment. Yet many of the 240 million or more people who live in forested areas live in poverty. There is surprisingly little empirical knowledge to answer basic yet highly relevant questions about the forestry–poverty nexus. At least one-quarter of the forested land in developing countries is under some form of community control, and that proportion is likely to increase. Domestic markets for forest products are also expanding, and should create new economic opportunities for low-income households.

The Nature Conservancy has developed a strategic, science-based planning process, which helps to identify the highest-priority places that, if conserved, promise to ensure biodiversity over the long term. One of TNC’s values is “Respect for People, Communities, and Cultures” as TNC recognises that enduring conservation success depends on the active involvement of people and partners whose lives and livelihoods are linked to the natural systems we seek to conserve. The Nature Conservancy works in more than 30 countries.","1. Wakatobi National Park (Indonesia): Fishers Community of Tomia Island established a group called Komunto to collaboratively develop the fisher community’s resources and sustainably manage marine resources. <BR>2.

Native Lands in the Amazon (South America: Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela): TNC and partners in the Native Lands in the Amazon programme are working with indigenous organisations, training indigenous groups in satellite mapping and land management. This programme is strengthening indigenous technical, financial and administrative capacity to protect huge swaths of land, and supporting their efforts to influence the government laws and programmes that can also determine their future.<BR>4. Forest Management Project, Adelberts, Madang Province (Papua New Guinea): The key focus of this Project, implemented by TNC and partners, is to facilitate sustainably best practices of forest management with local resource owners through development of land use plans and management plans. <BR>5. Indigenous Ecotourism Network, promoted by the Amistad Project (Costa Rica): Seventeen community-based groups from the Atlantic sector of the site (Talamanca Bribri Indigenous territory) have organized themselves through a formal structure – The Indigenous Ecotourism Network. They have developed their own decision-making mechanisms, rules and procedures, and have reached an agreement regarding the type of tourism activities to be promoted in their indigenous territory. TNC supports this network that consolidated cultural and nature tourism as an alternative income-generating activity for indigenous communities living in the buffer zone area of the park.<BR>6. The Amazon Indigenous Training Center (Brazil): TNC supports an Indigenous Training Center in the Brazilian amazon region equipping the next generation of indigenous leaders with the tools and expertise to lead their communities into a more secure future, making connections with other indigenous organisations across the hemisphere facing the same problems and building regional networks. <BR>7. Grasslands of the Mongolian Steppe and Tibetan Plateau (Mongolia and China): TNC supports a programme to protect grasslands and savannah at a scale large enough to sustain the wildlife and the livelihoods of nomadic people who live there.

CI’s vision is that we imagine a healthy prosperous world in which societies are forever committed to caring for and valuing nature for the long-term benefit of people and all life on Earth. Building upon a strong foundation of science, partnership and field demonstration, CI empowers societies to responsibly and sustainably care for nature for the well-being of humanity.<BR>CI is committed to helping societies adopt a more sustainable approach to development – one that considers and values nature at every turn. Some of the lead programmes with activities underway supporting human well-being and poverty reduction research, implementation, and policy analysis include:<BR>- The Science and Knowledge Division (formerly the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science) brings together leading experts in science and technology to collect and interpret data about biodiversity, develop strategic plans for conservation, and forge partnerships in all sectors that promote conservation goals.<BR>- The Center for Conservation and Government (CCG) assists CI’s government partners in overcoming challenges in balancing conservation with their respective development goals, economic interests, and political realities, helping leaders understand and act on the important issues facing our planet’s ecological health.

The fund is a global leader in enabling civil society to participate in and benefit from conserving some of the world's most critical ecosystems. A significant number of CEPF grants have provided the basis for improving incomes and economic well-being of poor communities (www.cepf.net).<BR>- The Conservation Stewards Program (CSP) uses Conservation Agreements to achieve poverty reduction and improve human wellbeing while pursuing measurable conservation outcomes. Conservation Agreements are negotiated arrangements with communities in which development support is provided in exchange for contributions to conservation actions, thus reflecting a direct-incentive approach (www.conservation.org/csp).<BR>- The Food Security Initiative is built upon the organisation’s extensive experience in promoting sustainable rural livelihoods all over the world and leading cutting edge applied research in the field. CI seeks to understand, demonstrate, enhance and leverage the role of nature in helping ensure that people have access to adequate food for a nutritious diet at all times.<BR>- The Indigenous & Traditional Peoples Program is a key component of CI’s new strategy, well-positioned to help achieve CI’s vision for a healthy world and societies committed to caring for nature. <BR>- Verde Ventures provides debt and equity financing to businesses that benefit healthy ecosystems and human well-being, such as agroforestry, ecotourism, sustainable harvest of wild products and marine initiatives.

The WWF Network policy on poverty and conservation defines poverty as encompassing not only physiological deprivation (non-fulfillment of basic needs, lack of income, ill-health, etc.), but also social deprivation and vulnerability (lack of access to natural resources, discrimination, lack of voice and power, gender inequities, etc.). WWF therefore sees its work on poverty as wide-ranging and requiring coordinated action at all levels, from the field to the global policy arena. The policy affirms WWF’s commitment to embrace a pro-poor approach to conservation, to strive to find equitable solutions for people and the environment, and to making special efforts to enable local people to play a key part in crafting solutions for sustainable development.<BR>WWF understands that a healthy, functioning environment is fundamental to people's well-being, and much recent work has focused on improving environmental governance to ensure both positive environmental impacts and the well-being of people, especially poor and marginalised groups. The focus on governance has generated a unique insight into the global challenges we face today, including those of poverty, climate change, consumption, trade and economic growth.<BR>In the past three years an average of £4.43 million pa, approximating to 12% of WWF-UK’s total income, has been provided by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) specifically to tackle poverty and promote sustainable livelihoods through good environmental management.","WWF-UK expressly works to strengthen the role of civil society to ensure good governance and management of natural resources at local and national level in several countries. This has included extending support to many more Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in many countries. Benefits to the poor have included securing/formalising of rights over natural resources, and protection of these resources, empowerment (giving voice to the poor and marginalised) and building of social capita, livelihood diversification, the prevention or reduction of the impact of conflict between people and wildlife, access to services and development opportunities. Poor women have greater influence and involvement in decision-making and in economic opportunities.<BR>Climate change is occurring at an ever-increasing rate and scale, and there is an urgent need for action to reduce both the extent of climate change and vulnerability to its impacts. WWF-UK is supporting initiatives at multiple levels. At the local level WWF-UK is testing and piloting adaptation strategies. WWF-UK is also working with national governments in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, and South Africa to develop and implement low carbon development pathways with a focus on smart energy generation and consumption. In heavily forested countries such as Brazil and PNG WWF-UK is supporting governments to progress potential opportunities from REDD. For many countries WWF-UK is working with (including vulnerable countries such as Nepal, Belize and Honduras) support is provided to develop adaptation responses. In each case this involves providing technical support, commissioning research, and facilitating dialogues and forums. In some cases work involves strengthening local civil society to participate and respond in national dialogues. At the international level WWF-UK is campaigning to ensure that heads of government and powerful decision-makers commit to climate change agreements that are fair, equitable, binding and based on science. A focus of the work has been on helping both civil society and national governments from vulnerable countries to have a strong voice up to and during UNFCCC negotiations.<BR>WWF-UK is working through partners in the WWF network and beyond to effect sustainable and equitable production, trade and consumption.","002--|019--|142--|009--|","Glyn Davies, Programme Director<BR>E-mail: gdavies@wwf.org.uk<BR>Mike Morris, Social Development Adviser<BR>E-mail: mmorris@wwf.org.uk<BR>Kate Studd, Socio-economic Programme Adviser<BR>E-mail: kstudd@wwf.org.uk<BR>Dominic White, Head, Government Partnerships Team<BR>E-mail: dwhite@wwf.org.uk<BR>Jennifer Peer, PPA Manager<BR>E-mail: jpeer@wwf.org.uk","http://www.wwf.org.uk",".  wwf uk programmes division wwf uk panda house weyside park godalming surrey gu7 1xr uk phone 44 0 1483 426 444 fax 44 0 1483 426 409 150 154 826 wwf’s mission is to stop the degradation of the planet s natural environment and to build a future in which people live in harmony with nature;

Non-timber resources include a wide range of products and services of the forest such as foods, health products, flavours and essences, floral greens, ornamental and craft products as well as tourism services, biodiversity conservation, watershed management, and the increasingly important area of carbon management. <BR>CLE has been successful in raising the profile of non-timber forest products and other non-timber resources in sustainable forest management and rural development.

It therefore follows that natural resources governance is critical to sustainable development, human welfare, good governance and enfranchisement of rural communities.<BR>ZELA’s work is centred on ensuring that the various environmental laws, policies and the resultant institutional frameworks result in the empowerment of natural resources dependent communities to enable them to participate meaningfully and effectively in environmental governance.

Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs), which fall under the TBNRM programme, are viewed as having the potential to make a significant contribution to socio-economic development in southern Africa through the sustainable consumptive use of wild animals and plants. Proponents and advocates of TBNRM processes and TFCAs initiatives in southern Africa have postulated rural communities living adjacent to conservation areas as one of the main determinants of the success of such initiatives and thus they should be potential beneficiaries along with the state and the private sector. This assertion is reflected in the various Memoranda of Understanding (MoU), treaties, policies and agreements establishing transfrontier conservation initiatives in the region.<BR>2.

This includes poverty eradication and environmental management. The Local Government Act 1997 decentralised certain environment management functions to districts, municipalities, town councils or divisions.<BR>The decentralized functions that are now the responsibility of the districts, municipalities, town councils or division councils include: environment sanitation, water services, wetlands and forests, preservation of the environment through the protection of forests, wetlands, lakeshores, streams and prevention of environment degradation, camping and grazing sites, sanitary services and regulation of refuse, noise regulation, quarrying, burning rubbish and grasslands, maintenance of public unoccupied land and fire control.","1. Community Wetland Management Action Planning Project: This project is aimed at directly involving communities in conserving the wetlands on which a very large number of people depend for livelihood and sustenance. It envisages creating awareness among the communities directly using the wetlands for income generation and those living close to the wetlands on wise and sustainable use of wetlands, the wetland law and national policy for the conservation and management of the wetland resources. It also aims at giving those very communities a chance to draw and participate in implementing relevant action plans for conserving the wetlands so as to increase and prolong benefit from the wetlands. The project ultimately aims to create buffer zones between the wetlands and the mainland so as to rid the wetlands of the (generally elite) encroachers who are degrading the wetland systems upon which the poor people depend for survival.<BR>2. Briquette and Peel Bran Making Project: This project involves communities in making briquettes out of waste. Communities are trained to reuse waste which for a long time has usually been disposed of inappropriately. The project aims to reduce the quantity of waste cast into the environment. It aims at involving the communities in reusing waste material, turning it into a source of income. The communities use banana peelings to produce energy briquettes and peel bran, which they sell to get income. The peel bran can also be fed to livestock and poultry, reducing the cost of keeping livestock and poultry as a source of income. The project therefore helps to conserve the environment by reducing waste and eradicating poverty by providing a source of livelihoods.","002-014-800|","Godfrey Oluka&#8232;<BR>E-mail: g.oluka@yahoo.co.uk, Phone: +256782735365","http://www.kcc.go.ug",".  rubaga division kampala city council environment and natural resources section of the public health department rubaga division kampala city council environment and natural resources section of the public health department rubaga division p o box 7010 kampala uganda 002 014 800 rubaga division is a local government which is mandated by the local government act 1997 of uganda to provide services to and to design and implement development plans that aim at improving the living conditions of all persons living within its boundaries this includes poverty eradication and environmental management the local government act 1997 decentralised certain environment management functions to districts municipalities town councils or divisions the decentralized functions that are now the responsibility of the districts municipalities town councils or division councils include environment sanitation water services wetlands and forests preservation of the environment through the protection of forests wetlands lakeshores streams and prevention of environment degradation camping and grazing sites sanitary services and regulation of refuse noise regulation quarrying burning rubbish and grasslands maintenance of public unoccupied land and fire control 1 community wetland management action planning project this project is aimed at directly involving communities in conserving the wetlands on which a very large number of people depend for livelihood and sustenance it envisages creating awareness among the communities directly using the wetlands for income generation and those living close to the wetlands on wise and sustainable use of wetlands the wetland law and national policy for the conservation and management of the wetland resources it also aims at giving those very communities a chance to draw and participate in implementing relevant action plans for conserving the wetlands so as to increase and prolong benefit from the wetlands the project ultimately aims to create buffer zones between the wetlands and the mainland so as to rid the wetlands of the generally elite encroachers who are degrading the wetland systems upon which the poor people depend for survival 2 briquette and peel bran making project this project involves communities in making briquettes out of waste communities are trained to reuse waste which for a long time has usually been disposed of inappropriately the project aims to reduce the quantity of waste cast into the environment it aims at involving the communities in reusing waste material turning it into a source of income the communities use banana peelings to produce energy briquettes and peel bran which they sell to get income the peel bran can also be fed to livestock and poultry reducing the cost of keeping livestock and poultry as a source of income the project therefore helps to conserve the environment by reducing waste and eradicating poverty by providing a source of livelihoods godfrey oluka&#8232; e mail g oluka yahoo co uk phone 256782735365  .",,,"Alessandra Giuliani","2010-12-06 14:12:12"

PGS works in the periphery of the Dja Biospere Reserve in southeast Cameroon and offers a unique approach to the conservation of great apes by bringing revenue to local communities through scientific tourism and through development projects at the community level. The ultimate goal of PGS is the conservation of chimpanzees and gorillas in their natural habitat in non-protected areas (logging concessions, park buffer zones and village forests used for hunting and agriculture), where there are still healthy populations of apes but under extreme threat.<BR>As PGS works in these areas, its conservation work has a large social aspect and all activities and initiatives in the field are executed with the full agreement and participation of the people living, working, surviving or making money within great ape territory. As well as seeking external funding in order to provide development aids to the communities, the main strategy of PGS is the double-edged sword of scientific tourism. PGS' research site is used year-round by a number of national and international students, researchers and volunteers who come to PGS to study great apes and their habitat. What is special about the model of the PGS is that, in addition to the conservation advantage of improving understanding of a species within the scientific and conservation communities, scientific tourism also serves to keep local inhabitants in employment and to reinforce to them the value of living animals and intact forests, which in turn reduces need and desire to hunt locally, where the threatened apes live. Ape populations are awarded a local and hopefully long term respite.<BR>  <BR>Objectives of PGS:<BR>- Protection of great apes in their natural habitat by sustainable hunting and scientific tourism<BR>- To help stop poaching of protected species<BR>- The development and increased livelihood of rural communities<BR>- To provide alternatives to hunting<BR>- The local management, zoning and sustainable use of the forest and its resources","1.

Designated as a biodiversity conservation priority area, it experiences some of the highest rates of poverty and overfishing in the country. Local communities are traditionally fishers, dependent on marine resources for their livelihoods and food. Family sizes are large and the population is growing rapidly, with a dearth of employment.<BR>7. Using seahorses as a focus, Project Seahorse has already helped catalyse 33 community-managed no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. Although the Bank’s marine resources have been grossly depleted, new hope is emerging among local people as these MPAs have resulted in a measurable resurgence in marine life. www.zsl.org/conservation/regions/asia/project-seahorse/<BR>8.

Community management of the riverine resources in western lowland Nepal for the benefit of people and wildlife. In Nepal there is no Government policy on wild fisheries for the >1.5 million people who depend on them for income and nutrition. ZSL have developed a project to increase sustainability of the fisheries of the Karnali and Babai river systems in western Nepal through building capacity in marginalised fishing communities and Government. Riverine habitats are being degraded and destroyed and fishing communities that are already poor and marginalised face further threats to their health, food security and income. This prospective project aims to improve access to resources, implement the rights of, and promote social inclusion of marginalised fishing communities. Further, by developing a national policy, government capacity to manage this critical resource will be increased.<BR>12. Bushmeat Research Programme. The Bushmeat Research Programme is involved in research to enhance our understanding of the bushmeat trade in West and Central Africa, to assist both policy makers and project managers to develop effective methods of regulation and management for sustainability.
