This paper explores local perceptions of an ICDP that has been established for more than a decade around the Kilum?Ijim Forest, in North West Province, Cameroon. The study tested the assumptions underlying the ICDP: that by improving incomes and livelihoods from the land in and around the forest, pressure on the forest would decrease, contributing to conservation objectives. The study provides evidence that livelihood activities can have a conservation impact by helping to change local attitudes and behavior. Furthermore, the study analyzes and develops, some of the \"factors for success\" highlighted by previous papers.","|IC|","002-017-120|",,"10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00033-X","0040/EDI|O0006/CON|",".  abbot j i o thomas d h l gardner a a neba s e khen m w understanding the links between conservation and development in the bamenda highlands cameroon world development elsevier science ltd uk integrated conservation and development projects icdps attempt to link the conservation of natural resources with the development needs of local people recent reviews have provided differing perspectives on the relative success of icdps in addressing either their conservation or development objectives this paper explores local perceptions of an icdp that has been established for more than a decade around the kilum?ijim forest in north west province cameroon the study tested the assumptions underlying the icdp that by improving incomes and livelihoods from the land in and around the forest pressure on the forest would decrease contributing to conservation objectives the study provides evidence that livelihood activities can have a conservation impact by helping to change local attitudes and behavior furthermore the study analyzes and develops some of the factors for success highlighted by previous papers o0040 ed o0006 co  .",,,"O0371|E0049|E0015|E0010|C0111|B1378|B0677|B0032|B0001|B0293|O0091","O/Bees for Development|EL/Poverty and Conservation Learning Group Inception Meeting - Taking the Learning Group Forward 12-13 December 2005, UNEP-WCMC, Cambridge, UK|EE/WWF Science for Nature Symposium: Ecosystem services 31st October - 1st November 2006, Washington D.C., USA|EE/Nature and Poverty Symposium 15th February 2006, The Hague, Netherlands|C/Introduction of Beekeeping and Sunflower Production to Conserve the Environment|B/The Emergence and Spreading of an Improved Traditional Soil and Water Conservation Practice in Burkina Faso|B/Property Rights and the Marginal Wildebeest: An Economic Analysis of Wildlife Conservation Options in Kenya|B/Agroecology: The Science of Sustainable Agriculture|B/Understanding the Links Between Conservation and Development in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon|B/Agroforestry Parklands in sub-Saharan Africa|O/United Nations Environment Programme-World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)"

Externally, the model results show that the world demand for non-timber forestry products can lead to a win-win situation whereby both trade and environmental sustainability can be promoted. Monopolistic measures to control the supply of these products, for short-term price gains, are harmful economically and environmentally. By contrast, productivity-raising measures have a favourable impact on both the economy and the environment. Internally, the model results show that the growth of the rest of the economy has driven the economic growth of the forestry sector, but at the same time, its environmental degradation. Poverty and land tenure insecurity also contribute to this degradation. Fortunately, policies promoting basic needs satisfaction and property rights security are shown to be effective in mitigating environmental degradation in the forestry sector.

The economic analysis of household-level benefits reveals that poorer households are currently benefiting less in absolute terms from community forestry than less poor households. In terms of the contribution of forests to total household income, the study results suggest that the poor are actually less dependent on forests than the rich, a finding that is somewhat contradictory to results from other similar studies. The average ‘poor’ household obtains Nepalese rupees (Nrs) 7,756 gross income from community forest annually, while the more ‘rich’ households obtain on average Nrs 24,466 per year. In terms of the contribution of forests to net household income, the study results seem to suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship – as income increases dependency on forest resources may decline. Econometric analysis suggests that income from the community forests is related to socio-economic attributes and private endowments of households. Households with land and livestock assets and upper caste households gain more from the commons, while better-educated households depend less on forest resources. Female-headed households benefit less from community forests, further aggravating the inequity in distribution of benefits.

The past decade has witnessed an increasing emphasis on community-based forest management, with transference of forest management responsibility into the hands of local communities. However, although community forestry (CF) has succeeded in halting resource degradation and conservation of biodiversity, the equity aspect of CF not been fully examined. Nepal is a good location for a case study to examine this question, as community forest programs have been in place longer than in many other countries. This study analyzes the relationship between key household characteristics and common property resources used in order to assess whether poorer households are able to gain greater access to community forests as a result of institutional change. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that forest product collection from community forests is dependent on various socio-economic variables. In general it appears that land and livestock holdings, caste, education of family members and household economic status exert a strong influence on appropriating benefits from the commons. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that, at least for some key products, poorer households are currently facing more restricted access to community forests than ‘less poor’ or relatively better off households.","|Fo|","142-062-524|",,"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.008","0098/OPE|",". adhikari b di falco s lovett j c household characteristics and forest dependency evidence from common property forest management in nepal ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk in resource dependent rural areas of developing countries common property resource management has been considered as one of the most viable options for combining poverty reduction enhancement of local level economic development and biodiversity conservation the past decade has witnessed an increasing emphasis on community based forest management with transference of forest management responsibility into the hands of local communities however although community forestry cf has succeeded in halting resource degradation and conservation of biodiversity the equity aspect of cf not been fully examined nepal is a good location for a case study to examine this question as community forest programs have been in place longer than in many other countries this study analyzes the relationship between key household characteristics and common property resources used in order to assess whether poorer households are able to gain greater access to community forests as a result of institutional change both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that forest product collection from community forests is dependent on various socio economic variables in general it appears that land and livestock holdings caste education of family members and household economic status exert a strong influence on appropriating benefits from the commons based on this analysis it can be concluded that at least for some key products poorer households are currently facing more restricted access to community forests than ‘less poor’ or relatively better off households doi 10 1016 j ecolecon 2003 08 008 o0098 ac .",,,NULL,NULL

But despite its recent popularity, the concept of community is rarely defined or carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and management. We seek to redress this omission by investigating \"community\" in work concerning resource conservation and management. We explore the conceptual origins of the community, and the ways the term has been deployed in writings on resource use. We then analyze those aspects of community most important to advocates for community's role in resource management — community as a small spatial unit, as a homogeneous social structure, and as shared norms — and indicate the weaknesses of these approaches. Finally, we suggest a more political approach: community must be examined in the context of development and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and actors within communities, on how these actors influence decision-making, and on the internal and external institutions that shape the decision-making process.
