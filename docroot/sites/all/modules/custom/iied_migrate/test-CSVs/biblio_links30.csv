Externally, the model results show that the world demand for non-timber forestry products can lead to a win-win situation whereby both trade and environmental sustainability can be promoted. Monopolistic measures to control the supply of these products, for short-term price gains, are harmful economically and environmentally. By contrast, productivity-raising measures have a favourable impact on both the economy and the environment. Internally, the model results show that the growth of the rest of the economy has driven the economic growth of the forestry sector, but at the same time, its environmental degradation. Poverty and land tenure insecurity also contribute to this degradation. Fortunately, policies promoting basic needs satisfaction and property rights security are shown to be effective in mitigating environmental degradation in the forestry sector.

In terms of the contribution of forests to total household income, the study results suggest that the poor are actually less dependent on forests than the rich, a finding that is somewhat contradictory to results from other similar studies. The average ‘poor’ household obtains Nepalese rupees (Nrs) 7,756 gross income from community forest annually, while the more ‘rich’ households obtain on average Nrs 24,466 per year. In terms of the contribution of forests to net household income, the study results seem to suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship – as income increases dependency on forest resources may decline. Econometric analysis suggests that income from the community forests is related to socio-economic attributes and private endowments of households. Households with land and livestock assets and upper caste households gain more from the commons, while better-educated households depend less on forest resources. Female-headed households benefit less from community forests, further aggravating the inequity in distribution of benefits.

The past decade has witnessed an increasing emphasis on community-based forest management, with transference of forest management responsibility into the hands of local communities. However, although community forestry (CF) has succeeded in halting resource degradation and conservation of biodiversity, the equity aspect of CF not been fully examined. Nepal is a good location for a case study to examine this question, as community forest programs have been in place longer than in many other countries. This study analyzes the relationship between key household characteristics and common property resources used in order to assess whether poorer households are able to gain greater access to community forests as a result of institutional change. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that forest product collection from community forests is dependent on various socio-economic variables. In general it appears that land and livestock holdings, caste, education of family members and household economic status exert a strong influence on appropriating benefits from the commons. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that, at least for some key products, poorer households are currently facing more restricted access to community forests than ‘less poor’ or relatively better off households.","|Fo|","142-062-524|",,"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.008","0098/OPE|",". adhikari b di falco s lovett j c household characteristics and forest dependency evidence from common property forest management in nepal ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk in resource dependent rural areas of developing countries common property resource management has been considered as one of the most viable options for combining poverty reduction enhancement of local level economic development and biodiversity conservation the past decade has witnessed an increasing emphasis on community based forest management with transference of forest management responsibility into the hands of local communities however although community forestry cf has succeeded in halting resource degradation and conservation of biodiversity the equity aspect of cf not been fully examined nepal is a good location for a case study to examine this question as community forest programs have been in place longer than in many other countries this study analyzes the relationship between key household characteristics and common property resources used in order to assess whether poorer households are able to gain greater access to community forests as a result of institutional change both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that forest product collection from community forests is dependent on various socio economic variables in general it appears that land and livestock holdings caste education of family members and household economic status exert a strong influence on appropriating benefits from the commons based on this analysis it can be concluded that at least for some key products poorer households are currently facing more restricted access to community forests than ‘less poor’ or relatively better off households doi 10 1016 j ecolecon 2003 08 008 o0098 ac .",,,"0","0"

But despite its recent popularity, the concept of community is rarely defined or carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and management. We seek to redress this omission by investigating \"community\" in work concerning resource conservation and management. We explore the conceptual origins of the community, and the ways the term has been deployed in writings on resource use. We then analyze those aspects of community most important to advocates for community's role in resource management — community as a small spatial unit, as a homogeneous social structure, and as shared norms — and indicate the weaknesses of these approaches. Finally, we suggest a more political approach: community must be examined in the context of development and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and actors within communities, on how these actors influence decision-making, and on the internal and external institutions that shape the decision-making process.

Immediate priorities include the empowerment of local communities, poverty reduction, natural resource conservation, securing an adequate food supply and promoting food self-sufficiency. The paper begins reviewing the main features of Latin America's resource endowments and current ecological problems, as well as the interlinkages between the dominant economic strategies of the region and environmental problems. The challenges for sustainable rural development in Latin America given the current changes in macro- and micro-economic conditions are subsequently discussed. Promising local experiences in the rural sector are described and new directions and indicators for integrated technology evaluation procedures that incorporate sustainability concerns proposed.","|CC|PE|","019-419-|",,"10.1016/0921-8009(93)90049-C",,". altieri m a masera o sustainable rural development in latin america building from the bottom up ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk conventional top down development strategies have proved fundamentally limited in their ability to promote equitable and environmentally sustainable development in latin america poverty unhealthy living conditions and environmental degradation continue to be widespread problems within the region this paper argues for an urgent and comprehensive reframing of rural development strategies in latin america immediate priorities include the empowerment of local communities poverty reduction natural resource conservation securing an adequate food supply and promoting food self sufficiency the paper begins reviewing the main features of latin america s resource endowments and current ecological problems as well as the interlinkages between the dominant economic strategies of the region and environmental problems the challenges for sustainable rural development in latin america given the current changes in macro and micro economic conditions are subsequently discussed promising local experiences in the rural sector are described and new directions and indicators for integrated technology evaluation procedures that incorporate sustainability concerns proposed doi 10 1016 0921 8009 93 90049 c .",,,"B0001","Understanding the Links Between Conservation and Development in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon"

This paper challenges such assertions by first demystifying the Malthusian view that hunger is due to a gap between food production and human population growth. Second, we expose the fact that current bio-engineered crops are not designed to increase yields or for poor small farmers, so that they may not benefit from them. In addition, transgenic crops pose serious environmental risks, continuously underplayed by the biotechnology industry. Finally, it is concluded that there are many other agro-ecological alternatives that can solve the agricultural problems that biotechnology aims at solving, but in a much more socially equitable manner and in a more environmentally harmonious way.","|Ag|",,"http://agbioforum.org/v2n34/v2n34a03-altieri.pdf",,,". altieri m a rosset p ten reasons why biotechnology will not ensure food security protect the environment and reduce poverty in the developing world agbioforum advocates of biotechnology affirm that the application of genetic engineering to develop transgenic crops will increase world agricultural productivity enhance food security and move agriculture away from a dependence on chemical inputs helping to reduce environmental problems this paper challenges such assertions by first demystifying the malthusian view that hunger is due to a gap between food production and human population growth second we expose the fact that current bio engineered crops are not designed to increase yields or for poor small farmers so that they may not benefit from them in addition transgenic crops pose serious environmental risks continuously underplayed by the biotechnology industry finally it is concluded that there are many other agro ecological alternatives that can solve the agricultural problems that biotechnology aims at solving but in a much more socially equitable manner and in a more environmentally harmonious way http agbioforum org v2n34 v2n34a03 altieri pdf .",,,"0","0"

Part of this complex process involves the dissemination of practical approaches and strategies that merge technical solutions with political realities, so as to achieve practical and demonstrable results. But the Initiative has a larger goal to spur fundamental shifts in thinking and practice about reducing poverty and environmental degradation. This is an ambitious aim that is difficult to achieve. Yet one reality is evident: leadership is key. To this end, the Forum of Ministers on Poverty and Environment was established. The Forum is comprised of some 40 ministers — hailing from all parts of the world and representing a variety of fields — who have demonstrated a commitment to poverty reduction and sound environmental management. Forum members can be powerful and compelling advocates for changes in thinking and practice at home and in the international arena. This publication is the result of preparations for and discussions during the first full meeting of the Forum of Ministers on Poverty and Environment held in New York on 29 September 1999. It contains a brief report on the deliberations during the Forum meeting, a set of policies and instruments, and a background essay that details policy recommendations in various sectors. Together, these various pieces provide a practical overview as to how the international community can move towards the goals of poverty eradication and environmental regeneration.","|PE|",,"http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/index.cfm?DocumentID=5253&module=Library&page=Document",,"0146/DOU|",".  ambler j attacking poverty while improving the environment practical recommendations poverty & environment initiative european commission and the united nations development programme undp and the ec established the poverty and environment initiative to contribute to the efforts of the international community to meet its self imposed challenges at the un conferences part of this complex process involves the dissemination of practical approaches and strategies that merge technical solutions with political realities so as to achieve practical and demonstrable results but the initiative has a larger goal to spur fundamental shifts in thinking and practice about reducing poverty and environmental degradation this is an ambitious aim that is difficult to achieve yet one reality is evident leadership is key to this end the forum of ministers on poverty and environment was established the forum is comprised of some 40 ministers — hailing from all parts of the world and representing a variety of fields — who have demonstrated a commitment to poverty reduction and sound environmental management forum members can be powerful and compelling advocates for changes in thinking and practice at home and in the international arena this publication is the result of preparations for and discussions during the first full meeting of the forum of ministers on poverty and environment held in new york on 29 september 1999 it contains a brief report on the deliberations during the forum meeting a set of policies and instruments and a background essay that details policy recommendations in various sectors together these various pieces provide a practical overview as to how the international community can move towards the goals of poverty eradication and environmental regeneration http www energyandenvironment undp org undp index cfm documentid=5253&module=library&page=document o0146 dou  .",,,"0","0"

For the first time social scientists, anthropologists, and historians have been brought together with biologists, in order to illuminate previously neglected yet critically important social aspects of conservation thinking. The book is introduced by an overview of African conservation in the past, present, and future. There are sixteen papers on a wide range of topics from wildlife management to soil conservation, and from the Cape in the nineteenth century to Ethiopia in the 1980s. These collectively show that conservation must form an integral part of future policies for human development. To date, conservation has been largely the domain of the biologist, but the current ecological crisis in Africa and the failure of orthodox conservation policies demand a radical new appraisal of conventional practices. This, therefore, is essential reading for all those concerned about people and conservation in Africa.","|CG|",,"Cambridge University Press<BR>Email: directcustserve@cambridge.org<BR>Phone: +44 (0)1223 326050",,,".  anderson d grove r conservation in africa people policies and practice cambridge university press cambridge uk a new interdisciplinary look at the practices and policies of conservation in africa is presented in this volume for the first time social scientists anthropologists and historians have been brought together with biologists in order to illuminate previously neglected yet critically important social aspects of conservation thinking the book is introduced by an overview of african conservation in the past present and future there are sixteen papers on a wide range of topics from wildlife management to soil conservation and from the cape in the nineteenth century to ethiopia in the 1980s these collectively show that conservation must form an integral part of future policies for human development to date conservation has been largely the domain of the biologist but the current ecological crisis in africa and the failure of orthodox conservation policies demand a radical new appraisal of conventional practices this therefore is essential reading for all those concerned about people and conservation in africa cambridge university press email directcustserve cambridge org phone 44 0 1223 326050  .",,,"0","0"

In many regions animal genetic resources (AnGR) are a vital component of this biodiversity. An estimated 1.96 billion people rely on livestock to supply part, or their entire daily needs. Complex, diverse and risk-prone peasant livelihood systems need AnGR that are capable of performing the functions required of them in these systems—AnGR that are flexible, resistant and diverse. In order to assess the importance of AnGR, as distinct from livestock per se, for sustaining and improving the livelihoods of the poor, the factors that differentiate between species and breeds in terms of the functions that animals fulfil in livelihoods and household economies need to be better understood. Central to this is the need to understand the functions of livestock as household assets, the full set of purposes the poor have in investing resources in livestock keeping, and the genetic traits that are important for the fulfilment of these purposes. If AnGR conservation is to make a contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers, the relative importance of AnGR from the livestock keepers’ perspective should be appraised. Then ways of maintaining and enhancing AnGR best suited to improving the livelihoods of the poor and ensuring equitable access to these resources can be addressed.","|Ag|",,,"10.1016/S0921-8009(03)00088-0","0220/OPE|",". anderson s animal genetic resources and sustainable livelihoods ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk many of the world s poor depend directly upon genetic species and ecosystem biodiversity for their livelihoods in many regions animal genetic resources angr are a vital component of this biodiversity an estimated 1 96 billion people rely on livestock to supply part or their entire daily needs complex diverse and risk prone peasant livelihood systems need angr that are capable of performing the functions required of them in these systems—angr that are flexible resistant and diverse in order to assess the importance of angr as distinct from livestock per se for sustaining and improving the livelihoods of the poor the factors that differentiate between species and breeds in terms of the functions that animals fulfil in livelihoods and household economies need to be better understood central to this is the need to understand the functions of livestock as household assets the full set of purposes the poor have in investing resources in livestock keeping and the genetic traits that are important for the fulfilment of these purposes if angr conservation is to make a contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers the relative importance of angr from the livestock keepers’ perspective should be appraised then ways of maintaining and enhancing angr best suited to improving the livelihoods of the poor and ensuring equitable access to these resources can be addressed doi 10 1016 s0921 8009 03 00088 0 o0220 ac .",,,"0","0"
