Externally, the model results show that the world demand for non-timber forestry products can lead to a win-win situation whereby both trade and environmental sustainability can be promoted. Monopolistic measures to control the supply of these products, for short-term price gains, are harmful economically and environmentally. By contrast, productivity-raising measures have a favourable impact on both the economy and the environment. Internally, the model results show that the growth of the rest of the economy has driven the economic growth of the forestry sector, but at the same time, its environmental degradation. Poverty and land tenure insecurity also contribute to this degradation. Fortunately, policies promoting basic needs satisfaction and property rights security are shown to be effective in mitigating environmental degradation in the forestry sector.

The economic analysis of household-level benefits reveals that poorer households are currently benefiting less in absolute terms from community forestry than less poor households. In terms of the contribution of forests to total household income, the study results suggest that the poor are actually less dependent on forests than the rich, a finding that is somewhat contradictory to results from other similar studies. The average ‘poor’ household obtains Nepalese rupees (Nrs) 7,756 gross income from community forest annually, while the more ‘rich’ households obtain on average Nrs 24,466 per year. In terms of the contribution of forests to net household income, the study results seem to suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship – as income increases dependency on forest resources may decline. Econometric analysis suggests that income from the community forests is related to socio-economic attributes and private endowments of households. Households with land and livestock assets and upper caste households gain more from the commons, while better-educated households depend less on forest resources. Female-headed households benefit less from community forests, further aggravating the inequity in distribution of benefits.

The past decade has witnessed an increasing emphasis on community-based forest management, with transference of forest management responsibility into the hands of local communities. However, although community forestry (CF) has succeeded in halting resource degradation and conservation of biodiversity, the equity aspect of CF not been fully examined. Nepal is a good location for a case study to examine this question, as community forest programs have been in place longer than in many other countries. This study analyzes the relationship between key household characteristics and common property resources used in order to assess whether poorer households are able to gain greater access to community forests as a result of institutional change. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that forest product collection from community forests is dependent on various socio-economic variables. In general it appears that land and livestock holdings, caste, education of family members and household economic status exert a strong influence on appropriating benefits from the commons. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that, at least for some key products, poorer households are currently facing more restricted access to community forests than ‘less poor’ or relatively better off households.","|Fo|","|142-062-524|",,"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.008","|O0098/OPE|",". adhikari b di falco s lovett j c household characteristics and forest dependency evidence from common property forest management in nepal ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk in resource dependent rural areas of developing countries common property resource management has been considered as one of the most viable options for combining poverty reduction enhancement of local level economic development and biodiversity conservation the past decade has witnessed an increasing emphasis on community based forest management with transference of forest management responsibility into the hands of local communities however although community forestry cf has succeeded in halting resource degradation and conservation of biodiversity the equity aspect of cf not been fully examined nepal is a good location for a case study to examine this question as community forest programs have been in place longer than in many other countries this study analyzes the relationship between key household characteristics and common property resources used in order to assess whether poorer households are able to gain greater access to community forests as a result of institutional change both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that forest product collection from community forests is dependent on various socio economic variables in general it appears that land and livestock holdings caste education of family members and household economic status exert a strong influence on appropriating benefits from the commons based on this analysis it can be concluded that at least for some key products poorer households are currently facing more restricted access to community forests than ‘less poor’ or relatively better off households doi 10 1016 j ecolecon 2003 08 008 o0098 ac .",,

In a break from previous work on development which considered communities a hindrance to progressive social change, current writings champion the role of community in bringing about decentralization, meaningful participation, and conservation. But despite its recent popularity, the concept of community is rarely defined or carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and management. We seek to redress this omission by investigating \"community\" in work concerning resource conservation and management. We explore the conceptual origins of the community, and the ways the term has been deployed in writings on resource use. We then analyze those aspects of community most important to advocates for community's role in resource management — community as a small spatial unit, as a homogeneous social structure, and as shared norms — and indicate the weaknesses of these approaches. Finally, we suggest a more political approach: community must be examined in the context of development and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and actors within communities, on how these actors influence decision-making, and on the internal and external institutions that shape the decision-making process. A focus on institutions rather than \"community\" is likely to be more fruitful for those interested in community-based natural resource management.","|CC|","|",,"10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00161-2","|",". agrawal a gibson c enchantment and disenchantment the role of community in natural resource conservation world development elsevier science ltd uk the poor conservation outcomes that followed decades of intrusive resource management strategies and planned development have forced policy makers and scholars to reconsider the role of community in resource use and conservation in a break from previous work on development which considered communities a hindrance to progressive social change current writings champion the role of community in bringing about decentralization meaningful participation and conservation but despite its recent popularity the concept of community is rarely defined or carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and management we seek to redress this omission by investigating community in work concerning resource conservation and management we explore the conceptual origins of the community and the ways the term has been deployed in writings on resource use we then analyze those aspects of community most important to advocates for community s role in resource management — community as a small spatial unit as a homogeneous social structure and as shared norms — and indicate the weaknesses of these approaches finally we suggest a more political approach community must be examined in the context of development and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and actors within communities on how these actors influence decision making and on the internal and external institutions that shape the decision making process a focus on institutions rather than community is likely to be more fruitful for those interested in community based natural resource management doi 10 1016 s0305 750x 98 00161 2 .",,

Second, we expose the fact that current bio-engineered crops are not designed to increase yields or for poor small farmers, so that they may not benefit from them. In addition, transgenic crops pose serious environmental risks, continuously underplayed by the biotechnology industry.

But the Initiative has a larger goal to spur fundamental shifts in thinking and practice about reducing poverty and environmental degradation. This is an ambitious aim that is difficult to achieve. Yet one reality is evident: leadership is key. To this end, the Forum of Ministers on Poverty and Environment was established. The Forum is comprised of some 40 ministers — hailing from all parts of the world and representing a variety of fields — who have demonstrated a commitment to poverty reduction and sound environmental management. Forum members can be powerful and compelling advocates for changes in thinking and practice at home and in the international arena. This publication is the result of preparations for and discussions during the first full meeting of the Forum of Ministers on Poverty and Environment held in New York on 29 September 1999. It contains a brief report on the deliberations during the Forum meeting, a set of policies and instruments, and a background essay that details policy recommendations in various sectors.

In order to assess the importance of AnGR, as distinct from livestock per se, for sustaining and improving the livelihoods of the poor, the factors that differentiate between species and breeds in terms of the functions that animals fulfil in livelihoods and household economies need to be better understood. Central to this is the need to understand the functions of livestock as household assets, the full set of purposes the poor have in investing resources in livestock keeping, and the genetic traits that are important for the fulfilment of these purposes. If AnGR conservation is to make a contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers, the relative importance of AnGR from the livestock keepers’ perspective should be appraised.

In using and managing forests to maintain flows of material and environmental inputs into their livelihood systems, people often transform the resource. While pressures of poverty can mean that this leads to deforestation, it is incorrect to assume that this will necessarily happen. The existence of multiple categories of user, with different and often competing interests, can mean that developing equitable and effective systems of participatory control and management of forests can be difficult. In particular, the needs of the poor to have continued access to forests to sustain subsistence and coping livelihood strategies, are likely to conflict with the interests of the wealthier and industry in privatising forest product flows in order to exploit market opportunities. Four main areas of recommendation are discussed in the paper. One argues for a livelihoods approach to identifying constraints faced by the poor and priorities for action. A second stresses the need to strengthen governance systems, to enable the poor who draw on forests to do so equitably within systems characterised by multiple uses and multiple stakeholders. A third focuses on bringing about necessary policy reforms to underpin more equitable and sustainable forest use and management, and on strengthening mechanisms to implement and enforce such reforms. The fourth emphasises the importance of promoting partnerships among those with interests in sustainable forest management, at both the policy and local governance levels, in order to advance such changes.","|Fo|","|","http://www.undp.org/biodiversity/biodiversitycd/Forests%20and%20the%20poverty-environment%20nexus.pdf",,"|O0146/DOU|",". arnold j e m bird p forests and the poverty environment nexus prepared for the undp ec expert workshop on poverty and the environment brussels belgium january 20 21 1999 linkages between the rural poor and the forest resources they draw upon are complex in using and managing forests to maintain flows of material and environmental inputs into their livelihood systems people often transform the resource while pressures of poverty can mean that this leads to deforestation it is incorrect to assume that this will necessarily happen the existence of multiple categories of user with different and often competing interests can mean that developing equitable and effective systems of participatory control and management of forests can be difficult in particular the needs of the poor to have continued access to forests to sustain subsistence and coping livelihood strategies are likely to conflict with the interests of the wealthier and industry in privatising forest product flows in order to exploit market opportunities four main areas of recommendation are discussed in the paper one argues for a livelihoods approach to identifying constraints faced by the poor and priorities for action a second stresses the need to strengthen governance systems to enable the poor who draw on forests to do so equitably within systems characterised by multiple uses and multiple stakeholders a third focuses on bringing about necessary policy reforms to underpin more equitable and sustainable forest use and management and on strengthening mechanisms to implement and enforce such reforms the fourth emphasises the importance of promoting partnerships among those with interests in sustainable forest management at both the policy and local governance levels in order to advance such changes http www undp org biodiversity biodiversitycd forests%20and%20the%20poverty environment%20nexus pdf o0146 do .",,

Respondents' attitudes towards conservation were positive, motivated by both use and intrinsic values, and with reference to future generations. Attitudes were significantly related to locally perceived benefits. Respondents found most of the Park's resources useful but differences between user groups were significant.

Population growth, poverty, and open access probably explain most 'overuse' in such areas, but these are very difficult, long-term problems. The paper argues that under such conditions interim demand-side policies should be seriously considered, but the case is also made that the set of feasible instruments is quite small. Focusing on the case of Nepal, two instruments for reducing fuelwood demand – promotion of more efficient, wood-burning cookstoves and policies that reduce the prices of alternative fuels (e.g., through subsidies) – are evaluated. Using a simple analytical model and results from two household surveys conducted in Nepal, it is concluded that promoting improved stoves is a much more efficient and equitable instrument than, for example, subsidizing the major alternative fuel, which is kerosene. The cost of fuelwood saved using improved stoves is predicted to be a very low $2.77 per metric ton.","|GP|","|","Cambridge University Press<BR>Phone: +44 (0)1223 326070<BR>Email: journals@cambridge.org",,"|O0218/OPE|",". bluffstone r a reducing degradation of forests in poor countries when permanent solutions elude us what instruments do we really have environment and development economics cambridge university press cambridge uk this paper evaluates policies for addressing forest degradation in developing country hill areas where agriculture is the major activity and villagers depend on forests for important economic inputs population growth poverty and open access probably explain most overuse in such areas but these are very difficult long term problems the paper argues that under such conditions interim demand side policies should be seriously considered but the case is also made that the set of feasible instruments is quite small focusing on the case of nepal two instruments for reducing fuelwood demand – promotion of more efficient wood burning cookstoves and policies that reduce the prices of alternative fuels e g through subsidies – are evaluated using a simple analytical model and results from two household surveys conducted in nepal it is concluded that promoting improved stoves is a much more efficient and equitable instrument than for example subsidizing the major alternative fuel which is kerosene the cost of fuelwood saved using improved stoves is predicted to be a very low $2 77 per metric ton cambridge university press phone 44 0 1223 326070 email journals cambridge org o0218 ac .",,

Four major questions: are posed: (i) What issues of environmental concerns and opportunities are identified in the PRSPs?; (ii) To what extent are poverty-environment causal links analyzed?; (iii) To what extent are environmental management responses and indicators put in place as part of the poverty reduction efforts?; and (iv) To what extent has the design and documentation of the process allowed for mainstreaming the environment? The review finds:: There is considerable variation across countries in the degree of mainstreaming: from a high score of 2.2 (Mozambique) to a low of 0.3 (Sao Tome Principe). Scores indicate the approximate level of attention given to environmental matters in the PRSPs. Some variation across countries is legitimate and to be expected, but there is no reason to believe that the lower scoring countries are free from concerns of environmental health and natural resources degradation linked to poverty.

The paper also investigates how the pattern of crop production in agriculture, market accessibility and wildlife-induced damage to crops and domestic animals affect illegal hunting. The empirical results suggest that effort in illegal hunting is inversely related to participation in SRCP. The results also show that the likelihood of illegal hunting is a decreasing function of the amount of agricultural land cultivated for maize production.

The following sections address topics that were identified by professionals with expertise in biological and social sciences and conservation practice. The topics are: Involving the People, Addressing Local Needs in Conservation, and Managing a Sustainable Initiative. Volume II also consists of three main sections.

Capability is impaired when poor people's health is damaged by dirty water or air or by diseases related to the environment (such as malaria).

In semi-arid parts of Africa, for example, pastoralists have by no means the same interests as safari operators and tourists, or indeed as local settled farmers. Moreover, these conflicts of interest are likely to intensify as rural poverty and dependence on land increases. This ITDG Working Paper examines the impact of wildlife conservation policies on the lives of two communities in Kenya for whom living with wildlife is a daily issue. These communities found very little trade-off in terms of enhanced opportunities derived from local wildlife conservation strategies. Many complex cultural and social issues are raised by a shift to cultivation and other means of survival for traditionally pastoralist peoples, none of which currently promote beneficial interactions with wildlife conservation. The paper presents detailed analysis of the two case studies, finding that prevailing wildlife conservation policies had neither strengthened livelihoods of the local people nor significantly conserved wildlife. The authors go on to identify desirable and feasible criteria for wildlife conservation projects to strengthen livelihoods and reduce poverty among pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities and conclude by offering a model for future collaborative ecotourism projects in socially fragmented park-adjacent communities.","|PA|IR|CS|","|002-014-404|",,,"|",". coupe s lewis v ogutu z watson c living with wildlife sustainable livelihoods for park adjacent communities in kenya itdg publishing conflicts over land use exist all over the worid in semi arid parts of africa for example pastoralists have by no means the same interests as safari operators and tourists or indeed as local settled farmers moreover these conflicts of interest are likely to intensify as rural poverty and dependence on land increases this itdg working paper examines the impact of wildlife conservation policies on the lives of two communities in kenya for whom living with wildlife is a daily issue these communities found very little trade off in terms of enhanced opportunities derived from local wildlife conservation strategies many complex cultural and social issues are raised by a shift to cultivation and other means of survival for traditionally pastoralist peoples none of which currently promote beneficial interactions with wildlife conservation the paper presents detailed analysis of the two case studies finding that prevailing wildlife conservation policies had neither strengthened livelihoods of the local people nor significantly conserved wildlife the authors go on to identify desirable and feasible criteria for wildlife conservation projects to strengthen livelihoods and reduce poverty among pastoralist and agro pastoralist communities and conclude by offering a model for future collaborative ecotourism projects in socially fragmented park adjacent communities .",,

The policy has two major aims: to increase land tenure security in order to encourage farmer involvement in intensive farming, and to eliminate slashandburn agriculture to protect the environment in a country still rich in forest resources. State intervention takes the form of land allocation, a process which combines the protection of some areas of village land with the formal recognition of private ownership in authorized farming areas. In a country with different types of geography, the effects of the policy are variable, but the research presented in this article demonstrates that the land laws have shortcomings which allow for differing interpretations depending on the local social relationships.

The predominant school of thought argues that poverty is a major cause of environmental degradation and if policy makers want to address the environmental issues, then they must first address the poverty problem. Another school of thought argues that this causal link is too simplistic and the nexus is governed by a complex web of factors. In this paper, a formal structure for analyzing the complex web of factors is formulated and used to review the existing literature on the links between poverty and the degradation of four natural resource sectors. The analysis highlights the institutional and market failures which encourage unsustainable activities, which in turn forces some income groups into poverty. Another important factor is the role of conflicts between different agents (income groups) in the poverty-environmental degradation nexus.

Moreover, the forest dweller’s life has, in many places, become one of misery. Industrial exploitation, while sometimes contributing to national and regional economies, has not benefited the rural poor and has often even led to the impoverishment of agricultural soils that are dependent on the protective value of the forests. Forestry for Local Community Development is a new people-oriented policy adopted by FAO, the objective of which is to raise the standard of living of the rural dweller, to involve him in the decision making processes which affect his very existence and to transform him into a dynamic citizen capable of contributing to a larger range of activities than he was used to and of which he will be the direct beneficiary. Forestry for Local Community Development is therefore about the rural people and for the rural people. Its ultimate objective is not physical but human. The physical goals which will be set are really means towards achieving the objective of enhancing the lives of human beings. And one of the vehicles which we advocate in order to assist in the achievement of these objectives is forestry. The first phase of formulating this policy has been completed with the publication of this document, which describes the rural dependence on wood, the major constraints which can be encountered when initiating programmes, and suggests possible solutions and specific forestry practices which can benefit the rural poor. Forestry for Local Community Development is in many respects a new departure in forest management and forest utilization.","|Fo|","|","http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/t0692e/t0692e00.htm",,"|O0021/EDI|",". fao forestry for local community development fao forestry papers fao rome for centuries individuals and communities have been able to live in harmony with their environment but during the past decades the rapid growth of populations and the higher expectations which have been generated throughout the world have led to an increase in the use of forests to such an extent that forests in many places have become degraded if they have not been razed to the ground moreover the forest dweller’s life has in many places become one of misery industrial exploitation while sometimes contributing to national and regional economies has not benefited the rural poor and has often even led to the impoverishment of agricultural soils that are dependent on the protective value of the forests forestry for local community development is a new people oriented policy adopted by fao the objective of which is to raise the standard of living of the rural dweller to involve him in the decision making processes which affect his very existence and to transform him into a dynamic citizen capable of contributing to a larger range of activities than he was used to and of which he will be the direct beneficiary forestry for local community development is therefore about the rural people and for the rural people its ultimate objective is not physical but human the physical goals which will be set are really means towards achieving the objective of enhancing the lives of human beings and one of the vehicles which we advocate in order to assist in the achievement of these objectives is forestry the first phase of formulating this policy has been completed with the publication of this document which describes the rural dependence on wood the major constraints which can be encountered when initiating programmes and suggests possible solutions and specific forestry practices which can benefit the rural poor forestry for local community development is in many respects a new departure in forest management and forest utilization http www fao org documents show_cdr asp url_file= docrep t0692e t0692e00 htm o0021 ed .",,

With current demographic shifts, many of yesterday's rural poor are becoming today's urban poor. Among other things, they require fuelwood, low cost construction materials and other wood products, easily accessible and affordable foods, and an adequate supply of clean water for drinking and for household use. There is a need to ensure not only that these people's demands for such products are met, but also that settlement patterns and land use changes do not result in environmental problems that affect the urban population at large. In addition to these goods and services, urban forestry provides amenity, recreational opportunities and other benefits for improved quality of life.<BR>The FAO Forestry Department, until now focused almost exclusively on rural forestry issues, recently launched a programme in urban and peri-urban forestry. The programme has concentrated initially on examining the potential role of urban forestry in developing countries, on increasing awareness of the issue, and on improving documentation and accessibility of information on the subject. An issue of UNASYLVA, FAO's forestry journal, was published on the topic in early 1993, and the document, “The Potential of Urban Forestry in Developing Countries: A Concept Paper”, was released in early 1994. A number of case studies on urban and peri-urban forestry currently are being written to document experiences and approaches in the various regions of the world.<BR>This annotated bibliography has been compiled to address the lack of easily accessible information on urban and peri-urban forestry in tropical and developing countries.

Among the more popular initiatives toward this objective is the use of development interventions in the peripheral areas of endangered ecosystems. Such interventions indirectly provide desirable ecosystem services by redirecting labor and capital away from activities that degrade ecosystems (e.g., agricultural intensification) and by encouraging commercial activities that supply ecosystem services as joint products (e.g., ecotourism). I examined the economics of such interventions and the available empirical evidence and concluded that development interventions are hindered by (1) the indirect and ambiguous conservation incentives that they generate, (2) the complexity of their implementation, and (3) their lack of conformity with the temporal and spatial dimensions of ecosystem conservation objectives. In contrast, paying individuals or communities directly for conservation performance may be a simpler and more effective approach. In recent years there has been widespread experimentation with contracting approaches to ecosystem conservation. Conservation contracting can (1) reduce the set of critical parameters that practitioners must affect to achieve conservation goals, (2) permit more precise targeting and more rapid adaptation over time, and (3) strengthen the links between individual well-being, individual actions, and habitat conservation, thus creating a local stake in ecosystem protection. In situations where performance payments are unlikely to work, indirect development interventions are also unlikely to work. Thus, despite the potential barriers to developing a system of conservation contracts in low-income nations, my analysis suggests that performance payments have the potential to improve the way in which ecosystems are conserved in these nations.","|MA|","|","http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004990.x",,"|O0217/OPE|",". ferraro p j global habitat protection limitations of development interventions and a role for conservation performance payments conservation biology blackwell publishing conservation biologists policy makers and citizens have identified the protection of native ecosystems in low income nations as a global social objective among the more popular initiatives toward this objective is the use of development interventions in the peripheral areas of endangered ecosystems such interventions indirectly provide desirable ecosystem services by redirecting labor and capital away from activities that degrade ecosystems e g agricultural intensification and by encouraging commercial activities that supply ecosystem services as joint products e g ecotourism i examined the economics of such interventions and the available empirical evidence and concluded that development interventions are hindered by 1 the indirect and ambiguous conservation incentives that they generate 2 the complexity of their implementation and 3 their lack of conformity with the temporal and spatial dimensions of ecosystem conservation objectives in contrast paying individuals or communities directly for conservation performance may be a simpler and more effective approach in recent years there has been widespread experimentation with contracting approaches to ecosystem conservation conservation contracting can 1 reduce the set of critical parameters that practitioners must affect to achieve conservation goals 2 permit more precise targeting and more rapid adaptation over time and 3 strengthen the links between individual well being individual actions and habitat conservation thus creating a local stake in ecosystem protection in situations where performance payments are unlikely to work indirect development interventions are also unlikely to work thus despite the potential barriers to developing a system of conservation contracts in low income nations my analysis suggests that performance payments have the potential to improve the way in which ecosystems are conserved in these nations http www blackwell synergy com doi full 10 1046 j 1523 1739 2001 015004990 x o0217 ac .",,

We review the development of an approach that integrates biodiversity conservation with agroforestry development through the active involvement of communities and their local governments near the Kitanglad Range Natural Park in the Manupali watershed, central Mindanao, the Philippines. Agroforestry innovations were developed to suit the biophysical and socioeconomic conditions of the buffer zone. These included practices for tree farming and conservation farming for annual cropping on slopes. Institutional innovations improved resource management, resulting in an effective social contract to protect the natural biodiversity of the park. The production of fruit and timber trees dramatically increased, re-establishing tree cover in the buffer zone. Natural vegetative contour strips were installed on several hundred sloping farms. Soil erosion and runoff declined, and the buffer strips increased maize yields by an average of 0.5 t/ha on hill-slope farms. The scientific knowledge base guided the development and implementation of a natural resource management plan for the municipality of Lantapan. A dynamic grass-roots movement of farmer-led Landcare groups evolved in the villages near the park boundary, which had a significant impact on conservation in both the natural and managed ecosystems. Encroachment in the natural park was reduced by 95% in 3 yr. The local Landcare groups also restored stream-corridor vegetation. This integrated approach has been recognized as a national model for the local management of natural resources and watersheds in the Philippines. Currently, the collaborating institutions are evolving a negotiation support system to resolve the interactions between the three management domains: the park, the ancestral domain claim, and the municipalities. This integrated systems approach operated effectively with highly constrained funding, suggesting that commitment and impact may best be stimulated by a \"drip-feed\" approach rather than by large, externally funded efforts.","|PA|IR|","|142-035-608|","http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol6/iss1/art12/",,"|",". garrity d p amoroso v b koffa s catacutan d buenavista g fay p dar w landcare on the poverty protection interface in an asian watershed conservation ecology serious methodological and policy hurdles constrain effective natural resource management that alleviates poverty while protecting environmental services in tropical watersheds we review the development of an approach that integrates biodiversity conservation with agroforestry development through the active involvement of communities and their local governments near the kitanglad range natural park in the manupali watershed central mindanao the philippines agroforestry innovations were developed to suit the biophysical and socioeconomic conditions of the buffer zone these included practices for tree farming and conservation farming for annual cropping on slopes institutional innovations improved resource management resulting in an effective social contract to protect the natural biodiversity of the park the production of fruit and timber trees dramatically increased re establishing tree cover in the buffer zone natural vegetative contour strips were installed on several hundred sloping farms soil erosion and runoff declined and the buffer strips increased maize yields by an average of 0 5 t ha on hill slope farms the scientific knowledge base guided the development and implementation of a natural resource management plan for the municipality of lantapan a dynamic grass roots movement of farmer led landcare groups evolved in the villages near the park boundary which had a significant impact on conservation in both the natural and managed ecosystems encroachment in the natural park was reduced by 95% in 3 yr the local landcare groups also restored stream corridor vegetation this integrated approach has been recognized as a national model for the local management of natural resources and watersheds in the philippines currently the collaborating institutions are evolving a negotiation support system to resolve the interactions between the three management domains the park the ancestral domain claim and the municipalities this integrated systems approach operated effectively with highly constrained funding suggesting that commitment and impact may best be stimulated by a drip feed approach rather than by large externally funded efforts http www ecologyandsociety org vol6 iss1 art12 .",,

We propose a model that shows that the ecological needs of the restoration area have the greatest potential to be met when human contributions are greatest. In turn, humans benefit increasingly as the restored ecosystem recovers.

This paper presents data from a case study of human-wildlife interactions in villages along the northern boundary of the Selous Game Reserve in south-east Tanzania. Since 1989, this area has been the site of a project working to promote community wildlife management (CWM). Questionnaire survey data were used to examine villagers' conservation attitudes towards wildlife, the Game Reserve, and the activities of the CWM project and state wildlife management authority. Despite local support for the conservation of wildlife, many respondents were either unaware or held negative views of the activities of the wildlife management institutions. Logistic regression analyses show that while access to game meat from the CWM project has had a positive influence on perceptions of wildlife benefits and awareness of the project's activities, it has had no significant effect on local perceptions of the Game Reserve and the activities of the state wildlife management authority. The factors underlying the observed pattern of conservation attitudes were identified as the inequitable distribution of benefits from the CWM project, and the limited nature of community participation in wildlife management.

In response to new market opportunities, tourism has emerged as part of national and regional strategies to maximise foreign exchange earnings, increase employment and provide financial resources to preserve natural and cultural heritage. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the process of tourism development at the local destination level. This report draws together the main findings from a three-year research project, funded by DFID, comparing the phenomenon of nature-based tourism at sites in India, Indonesia and Zimbabwe. It explores the complex relationship, at a local level, between tourists, 'host' communities, the tourism industry and the nature reserves and national parks where the wildlife tourism takes place. The research reveals that local stakeholders have little control over the form or magnitude of tourism development occuring around them, and remain vulnerable to external events and decision-making. Furthermore, local communities and protected areas are realising few benefits from international tourism, whilst deficiencies in monitoring and managing tourism development threaten to undermine the resource base upon which the industry relies. The challenges facing the various stakeholders are clearly defined, and only through partnership between the tourism industry, national and local authorities, investors, NGOs and the host communities will the sustainable solutions be realised.","|CS|MA|","|142-062-356|142-035-360|002-014-716|","IIED<BR>Phone: +44 (0) 20 7388-2117<BR>email: info@iied.org",,"|O0040/EDI|",". goodwin h kent i parker k walpole m tourism conservation and sustainable development case studies from asia and africa wildlife and development iied london international tourism is expected to increase well into the next century with a growing focus on destinations in the developing world as the industry expands into new areas it presents new opportunities and risks for host communities and natural environments in response to new market opportunities tourism has emerged as part of national and regional strategies to maximise foreign exchange earnings increase employment and provide financial resources to preserve natural and cultural heritage however relatively little attention has been paid to the process of tourism development at the local destination level this report draws together the main findings from a three year research project funded by dfid comparing the phenomenon of nature based tourism at sites in india indonesia and zimbabwe it explores the complex relationship at a local level between tourists host communities the tourism industry and the nature reserves and national parks where the wildlife tourism takes place the research reveals that local stakeholders have little control over the form or magnitude of tourism development occuring around them and remain vulnerable to external events and decision making furthermore local communities and protected areas are realising few benefits from international tourism whilst deficiencies in monitoring and managing tourism development threaten to undermine the resource base upon which the industry relies the challenges facing the various stakeholders are clearly defined and only through partnership between the tourism industry national and local authorities investors ngos and the host communities will the sustainable solutions be realised iied phone 44 0 20 7388 2117 email info iied org o0040 ed .",,

The key elements of such programs are that local communities participate in resource planning and management and that they gain economically from wildlife utilization. In part, CBC is seen as an alternative to the more exclusionary protectionist policies of the past, which often alienated rural people from conservation efforts. The new approach acts to make rural people a constituency for wildlife and therefore active backers of wildlife protection. Africans, however, are struggling with severe social and economic problems such as poverty, long-standing economic stagnation, rapid population growth, and environmental deterioration. Because of the pressures that Africans face in making a living, the application of CBC may not occur as readily or as successfully as its advocates would hope. It may also be that the approach is being oversold. I use brief case studies from Madagascar, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland to highlight the possible conflicts between rural people's economic needs and the implementation of community conservation. In addition, the CBC literature treats the role of protection vaguely, as it does the question of what might happen if CBC fails to achieve wildlife conservation goals. Community-based conservation is an obvious advance over past practices because of its inclusive philosophy, but if rural people accept CBC because of its economic benefits, they may reject it at some point in the future if a better economic alternative is presented. Thus, CBC programs can work to produce a better relationship between wildlife and people, but only a vast improvement in the lives of rural Africans will ultimately produce a more secure future for the continent's wildlife.","|CC|","|002--|","http://www.jstor.org/pss/2641687",,"|O0201/OPE|",".  hackel j d community conservation and the future of africa s wildlife conservation biology blackwell publishing the term community based conservation cbc refers to wildlife conservation efforts that involve rural people as an integral part of a wildlife conservation policy the key elements of such programs are that local communities participate in resource planning and management and that they gain economically from wildlife utilization in part cbc is seen as an alternative to the more exclusionary protectionist policies of the past which often alienated rural people from conservation efforts the new approach acts to make rural people a constituency for wildlife and therefore active backers of wildlife protection africans however are struggling with severe social and economic problems such as poverty long standing economic stagnation rapid population growth and environmental deterioration because of the pressures that africans face in making a living the application of cbc may not occur as readily or as successfully as its advocates would hope it may also be that the approach is being oversold i use brief case studies from madagascar ethiopia zimbabwe and swaziland to highlight the possible conflicts between rural people s economic needs and the implementation of community conservation in addition the cbc literature treats the role of protection vaguely as it does the question of what might happen if cbc fails to achieve wildlife conservation goals community based conservation is an obvious advance over past practices because of its inclusive philosophy but if rural people accept cbc because of its economic benefits they may reject it at some point in the future if a better economic alternative is presented thus cbc programs can work to produce a better relationship between wildlife and people but only a vast improvement in the lives of rural africans will ultimately produce a more secure future for the continent s wildlife http www jstor org pss 2641687 o0201 ope  .",,

Rights to Nature is a nontechnical, interdisciplinary introduction to the systems of rights, rules, and responsibilities that guide and control human use of the environment. Following a brief overview of the relationship between property rights and the natural environment, chapters consider: ecological systems and how they function; the effects of culture, values, and social organization on the use of natural resources; the design and development of property rights regimes and the costs of their operation; cultural factors that affect the design and implementation of property rights systems; coordination across geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. The book provides a valuable synthesis of information on how property rights develop, why they develop in certain ways, and the ways in which they function.

The demands made by market forces for the export of primary materials have been reasons for land degradation in the big farms, and the need to survive a poverty stricken existence has forced the peasantry to damage the marginal and fragile land they worked. Successive governments did not address these underlying causes of environmental degradation, and even the opportunities afforded by the environment programme that resulted from the 1979 Sandinista revolution, did not result in significant environmental improvements. The paper briefly considers the constraints faced by the Sandinista administration and how the farmer-to-farmer programme (Campesino-a-Campesino) was brought about as a result of the impacts of the Sandinista era. The substantive part of the paper considers PCAC's significance as an agroecological programme and its advantages and limitations for improving peasants' livelihoods via dissemination of land-protective measures. The viability of the programme is assessed by field work carried out examining in detail the case of three communities, and the paper concludes that the gains made in environmental protection and conservation are in jeopardy without structural policy changes.

Until now, most rural development projects have used incentives to mitigate the effects of the resulting environmental degradation.

Nevertheless, it is rare to observe spontaneous diffusion and medium- or long-term adoption of the technologies promoted through incentives on a significant number of farms or larger areas.

The State of Queensland) that native title to land and pastoral leaseholdings can co-exist. Drawing on themes of self-determination and co-existence, the paper looks at more specific topics such as aboriginal title to landwhat has been called land rights or native title in Australiaand some implications of that for land, sea and resource management. Central to this analysis are competing theories of Aboriginal land management and links between Aboriginal traditional knowledge and conservation of species. These are illustrated through the marine mammal, the dugong. The Australian debates lead to the Canadian debates and then to Scandinavia and the role of the Sami people in protection and management of the Arctic region. Issues of indigenous self determination inevitably provide an overall theme to these discussions. As a matter of global concern, the paper asks, but does not decide, whether indigenous peoples may manage fragile eco-systems more effectively than outsiders. It maintains that what is important in this context is a broader question. This concerns how culturally inclusive land and resource management can emerge from recognition of indigenous land and human rights and how comparative developments can provide crucial cross-jurisdictional information for future developments and opportunities in the interests of environmental conservation.","|IR|","|009-053-|","http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9337.00203",,"|O0241/OPE|",". hocking b a placing indigenous rights to self determination in an ecological context ratio juris blackwell publishing in this paper the author focuses on australian land management and in particular on the environmental management issues that could have been prompted by the high court recognition in 1996 in wik peoples v the state of queensland that native title to land and pastoral leaseholdings can co exist drawing on themes of self determination and co existence the paper looks at more specific topics such as aboriginal title to landwhat has been called land rights or native title in australiaand some implications of that for land sea and resource management central to this analysis are competing theories of aboriginal land management and links between aboriginal traditional knowledge and conservation of species these are illustrated through the marine mammal the dugong the australian debates lead to the canadian debates and then to scandinavia and the role of the sami people in protection and management of the arctic region issues of indigenous self determination inevitably provide an overall theme to these discussions as a matter of global concern the paper asks but does not decide whether indigenous peoples may manage fragile eco systems more effectively than outsiders it maintains that what is important in this context is a broader question this concerns how culturally inclusive land and resource management can emerge from recognition of indigenous land and human rights and how comparative developments can provide crucial cross jurisdictional information for future developments and opportunities in the interests of environmental conservation http www blackwell synergy com doi abs 10 1111 1467 9337 00203 o0241 ac .",,

In general, the rates were found to be very high. Factors influencing or correlated with the personal rates of time preference were investigated through regression methods. OLS was the technique used in the estimation. Market imperfections, particularly in credit and insurance markets lead to variation in RTPs. Poverty in assets, or cash liquidity constraints, was leading to or correlated with higher rates of time preference. The poor are, therefore, less likely to invest in environmental conservation. In Zambia, independent estimates of risk preferences were made. More risk-averse people tended to have lower RTPs. The results support the hypothesis that poverty and/or liquidity scarcity lead to high RTPs. Poverty reduction may thus reduce the RTPs of the poor and reduce the 'intertemporal externality' due to high RTPs. The high average RTPs indicate, however, that complementary policies may be needed to ensure sufficient levels of investment in conservation. Another logical implication is that institutionalization of private property rights may not be a sufficient tool to initiate sustainable resource management.","|MA|","|002-014-231|002-014-894|","Cambridge University Press<BR>Phone: +44 (0)1223 326070<BR>Email: journals@cambridge.org",,"|O0004/OPE|",". holden s t shiferaw b wik m poverty market imperfections and time preferences of relevance for environmental policy environment and development economics cambridge university press cambridge uk rates of time preference rtps of rural households in indonesia zambia and ethiopia have been measured using hypothetical questions about preferences for current versus future consumption in general the rates were found to be very high factors influencing or correlated with the personal rates of time preference were investigated through regression methods ols was the technique used in the estimation market imperfections particularly in credit and insurance markets lead to variation in rtps poverty in assets or cash liquidity constraints was leading to or correlated with higher rates of time preference the poor are therefore less likely to invest in environmental conservation in zambia independent estimates of risk preferences were made more risk averse people tended to have lower rtps the results support the hypothesis that poverty and or liquidity scarcity lead to high rtps poverty reduction may thus reduce the rtps of the poor and reduce the intertemporal externality due to high rtps the high average rtps indicate however that complementary policies may be needed to ensure sufficient levels of investment in conservation another logical implication is that institutionalization of private property rights may not be a sufficient tool to initiate sustainable resource management cambridge university press phone 44 0 1223 326070 email journals cambridge org o0004 ac .",,

Welfarists oppose all use that involves killing animals. Among conservationists polarization arises in part from failure to distinguish between different ideas nestled under the umbrella term of ‘sustainable use’. These include direct use as an imperative or choice, the ideal of keeping any use within biologically sustainable limits, and use as a possible conservation strategy that can create positive incentives, which are key where land could otherwise be converted to biodiversity-unfriendly practices. People will continue to use wild living resources, which increasing human populations could further deplete. In response the conservation community can follow one of two approaches. On the one hand, it can try to stop use through the establishment of strictly protected areas and by enforcing legislation, although many would question the ethical position of imposing such an approach. On the other hand, it can work to introduce the wider management systems needed to deliver sustainable use and, if possible, incentive-driven conservation. Because most rural populations will continue using wild living resources in human-dominated landscapes, sustainable use and incentive-driven conservation should both be at the centre of the conservation agenda this century. Both species- and ecosystem-based management are likely to have a role in sustainable use. However, current enthusiasm for the ecosystem approach may throw up unexpected consequences, making the search for sustainability even more polarized. Nevertheless, direct use of species cannot provide sufficient incentives to ensure the continued delivery of ecosystem services, which need to be fully incorporated in the global accounting system.","|MA|","|","http://www.resourceafrica.org/documents/2003/2003_incentive_driven_conservation.pdf",,"|O0274/OPE|O0022/CON|",".  hutton j m leader williams n sustainable use and incentive driven conservation realigning human and conservation interests oryx cambridge university press cambridge uk discussions of sustainable use have become polarized welfarists oppose all use that involves killing animals among conservationists polarization arises in part from failure to distinguish between different ideas nestled under the umbrella term of ‘sustainable use’ these include direct use as an imperative or choice the ideal of keeping any use within biologically sustainable limits and use as a possible conservation strategy that can create positive incentives which are key where land could otherwise be converted to biodiversity unfriendly practices people will continue to use wild living resources which increasing human populations could further deplete in response the conservation community can follow one of two approaches on the one hand it can try to stop use through the establishment of strictly protected areas and by enforcing legislation although many would question the ethical position of imposing such an approach on the other hand it can work to introduce the wider management systems needed to deliver sustainable use and if possible incentive driven conservation because most rural populations will continue using wild living resources in human dominated landscapes sustainable use and incentive driven conservation should both be at the centre of the conservation agenda this century both species and ecosystem based management are likely to have a role in sustainable use however current enthusiasm for the ecosystem approach may throw up unexpected consequences making the search for sustainability even more polarized nevertheless direct use of species cannot provide sufficient incentives to ensure the continued delivery of ecosystem services which need to be fully incorporated in the global accounting system http www resourceafrica org documents 2003 2003_incentive_driven_conservation pdf o0274 ope o0022 con  .",,
"272","B0469","Hyvarinen, J.|McNeill, C.|","200300","Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and the UN Millennium Declaration","Pa",,,,,,"7 pp.","UNDP, NY","This paper begins to examine the close and critical relationships among: biodiversity and ecosystem services; the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); and the goals set out in the UN Millennium Declaration, in particular the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The strong international consensus behind the Millennium Declaration makes it a unique and powerful basis for development cooperation. There is dawning recognition among decision-makers that biodiversity and ecosystem services are central to achieving the MDGs. This has created extremely important opportunities: biodiversity specialists can make a decisive contribution to the UN strategy for the MDGs, while the MDGs offer a gateway opportunity to advance conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The ‘WEHAB’ framework launched by the Secretary-General in May 2002 reinforced recognition of biodiversity, creating further opportunities. The UN strategy for the MDGs has four main elements: the Millennium Project; the Millennium Campaign; Country-Level Monitoring; and Country-Level Operations of the UN agencies. The MDGs come from Section III (development and poverty eradication) of the Millennium Declaration. The Secretary-General’s Road Map, which presents a plan for achieving the goals set out in the Millennium Declaration, focuses on the MDGs, among other things providing an indicator framework. Ecosystem services such as soil protection, pollution control and water purification have great economic value. Ecosystems provide food, health care and income generation opportunities. The sharpest interface between conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and poverty reduction is at the local community level, which is also where ingenuity, learning and innovation can be found, as exemplified by the projects selected as finalists for the Equator Initiative awards in 2002 (seewww.EquatorInitiative.org). Of course, biodiversity also has an intrinsic value, as the Preamble to the CBD recognizes, and this is interwoven with cultural, spiritual and other human values. A key challenge now is how to ‘scale up’: how to capture the lessons generated by projects such as those recognized by the Equator Initiative and translate them into wider application at the policy-making level. Another immediate challenge concerns follow-up of WEHAB: this paper proposes that a top priority for biodiversity practitioners after WSSD is taking the “B” for biodiversity forward in ways that help achieve the MDGs.","|OR|","|","http://www.equatorinitiative.org/images/stories/equatorknowledge/media_and_communications/ei_materials/Bioldiversity_Declaration_Paper.pdf",,"|O0146/DOU|",".  hyvarinen j mcneill c biodiversity ecosystem services and the un millennium declaration undp ny this paper begins to examine the close and critical relationships among biodiversity and ecosystem services; the convention on biological diversity cbd ; and the goals set out in the un millennium declaration in particular the millennium development goals mdgs the strong international consensus behind the millennium declaration makes it a unique and powerful basis for development cooperation there is dawning recognition among decision makers that biodiversity and ecosystem services are central to achieving the mdgs this has created extremely important opportunities biodiversity specialists can make a decisive contribution to the un strategy for the mdgs while the mdgs offer a gateway opportunity to advance conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity the ‘wehab’ framework launched by the secretary general in may 2002 reinforced recognition of biodiversity creating further opportunities the un strategy for the mdgs has four main elements the millennium project; the millennium campaign; country level monitoring; and country level operations of the un agencies the mdgs come from section iii development and poverty eradication of the millennium declaration the secretary general’s road map which presents a plan for achieving the goals set out in the millennium declaration focuses on the mdgs among other things providing an indicator framework ecosystem services such as soil protection pollution control and water purification have great economic value ecosystems provide food health care and income generation opportunities the sharpest interface between conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and poverty reduction is at the local community level which is also where ingenuity learning and innovation can be found as exemplified by the projects selected as finalists for the equator initiative awards in 2002 seewww equatorinitiative org of course biodiversity also has an intrinsic value as the preamble to the cbd recognizes and this is interwoven with cultural spiritual and other human values a key challenge now is how to ‘scale up’ how to capture the lessons generated by projects such as those recognized by the equator initiative and translate them into wider application at the policy making level another immediate challenge concerns follow up of wehab this paper proposes that a top priority for biodiversity practitioners after wssd is taking the “b” for biodiversity forward in ways that help achieve the mdgs http www equatorinitiative org images stories equatorknowledge media_and_communications ei_materials bioldiversity_declaration_paper pdf o0146 dou  .",,

It explores different theoretical perspectives (Neo-Marxist and Foucauldian) on globalization and why both are relevant to the case studies presented. Students are introduced to the practice of multi-sited ethnography and its centrality to the anthropological study of globalization. While drawing on examples from specific Maasai communities, the book is more broadly concerned with the historical and contemporary links between these communities and a global system of institutions, ideas, and money. The ecological incompatibility of Western national park-style conservation with East African savanna ecosystems and Maasai resource management practices, are highlighted. The concept of national parks is traced temporally and geographically from Maasai communities to the enclosure movement in 18th century England and westward expansion in 19th century North America. The relationships of parks to Judeo-Christian assumptions about \"man's place in nature,\" colonial ideologies like Manifest Destiny and the Civilizing Mission, and capitalist notions of private property and \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" are explored.

Programme activities included dialogue, conflict reduction, education, community resource access and support for community development. Surveys of attitudes show that communities benefited from the programme were significantly more positive towards the park and wildlife than communities that did not. The community conservation programme built an understanding of conservation objectives amongst communities whose members were more likely to recognize positive aspects of the park and less likely to demand that it be degazetted. Comparison over the 7-year duration of the programme, however, did not show that communities were generally more positive towards conservation. They were more critical of management and demanded more support and resources than they had received. Their behaviour was not greatly changed, and high levels of poaching and illegal grazing continued. Attitudes were influenced by communities receiving development assistance, but improvements were fragile, vulnerable to poor behaviour of park staff and law-enforcement activities. Both were seen as contradicting community approaches. Attitudes were also influenced by land ownership and economic occupation.

However, the specific contribution of other causes, particularly the role of smallholder forest farmers, is less well known and has been a subject of controversy and confusion. This paper explores the contextual causes (at the household level) of TMF loss around the Cross River National Park in south-east Nigeria. Local agricultural practices and household decision-making are linked to the wider political economy to explain the observed patterns of forest loss in the study area.

In an environment suffering from biomass and water shortages, erosion and land degradation, fast growing and resilient eucalyptus perform better than most indigenous tree species. Smallholders show a clear preference for eucalyptus poles, which are useful for farm implements and constructing dwellings and fences. In addition, the sale of eucalyptus poles and products has the potential to raise farm incomes, reduce poverty, increase food security and diversify smallholder-farming systems in less-favored areas of Tigray. Despite the potential for eucalyptus to improve rural livelihoods, in 1997 the regional government of Tigray imposed a ban on eucalyptus tree planting on farmlands. The ban was precipitated by concerns about the potential negative environmental externalities associated with eucalyptus, and the desire to reserve farmland for crop production. However, the regional government promotes the planting of eucalyptus in community woodlots, and has recently begun to allow private planting of eucalyptus on community wasteland and steep hillsides. In this paper, we review the ecological debate surrounding the planting of eucalyptus trees. In addition, the economic factors that influence smallholders to invest in tree production are considered. Ex ante benefit–cost analysis based on community and village level survey data from Tigray illustrates that planting eucalyptus yields high rates of return, well above 20% in most circumstances. The effect of variable harvest rates, and the potential costs of decreased crop production when eucalyptus trees are planted on or near farmlands are considered relative to our base case scenario. Based upon the review of the ecological and economic impacts of eucalyptus, we conclude that a policy option favoring the allocation of wastelands for private tree planting offers the greatest opportunity for rural smallholders.","|Fo|","|002-014-231|",,"10.1016/S1389-9341(01)00078-8","|O0039/EDI|",". jagger p pender j the role of trees for sustainable management of less favored lands the case of eucalyptus in ethiopia forest policy and economics elsevier science ltd uk in northern ethiopia eucalyptus is the most commonly observed tree species in community and household woodlots in an environment suffering from biomass and water shortages erosion and land degradation fast growing and resilient eucalyptus perform better than most indigenous tree species smallholders show a clear preference for eucalyptus poles which are useful for farm implements and constructing dwellings and fences in addition the sale of eucalyptus poles and products has the potential to raise farm incomes reduce poverty increase food security and diversify smallholder farming systems in less favored areas of tigray despite the potential for eucalyptus to improve rural livelihoods in 1997 the regional government of tigray imposed a ban on eucalyptus tree planting on farmlands the ban was precipitated by concerns about the potential negative environmental externalities associated with eucalyptus and the desire to reserve farmland for crop production however the regional government promotes the planting of eucalyptus in community woodlots and has recently begun to allow private planting of eucalyptus on community wasteland and steep hillsides in this paper we review the ecological debate surrounding the planting of eucalyptus trees in addition the economic factors that influence smallholders to invest in tree production are considered ex ante benefit–cost analysis based on community and village level survey data from tigray illustrates that planting eucalyptus yields high rates of return well above 20% in most circumstances the effect of variable harvest rates and the potential costs of decreased crop production when eucalyptus trees are planted on or near farmlands are considered relative to our base case scenario based upon the review of the ecological and economic impacts of eucalyptus we conclude that a policy option favoring the allocation of wastelands for private tree planting offers the greatest opportunity for rural smallholders doi 10 1016 s1389 9341 01 00078 8 o0039 ed .",,

Eight income-earning strategies were distinguished that reflect differences in comparative advantage between communities. We explain the choice of income earning strategy using a multinomial logit model that includes biophysical, economic, social and institutional variables. We use a probit model to show that adoption of conservation practices is determined by the type of income earning strategy, population density, market access, and organizational variables. Our results have some important policy implications. First, given the higher profitability of cash crops compared to staple foods, significant investments in road infrastructure are needed to better integrate hillside communities into the market economy. Second, while the potential of profitable conservation practices depends on the type of income earning strategy pursued, population density, market access and assistance from community-based and external organizations play an important role as well. The positive impact of population density on the adoption of many conservation technologies and investments becomes only effective at relatively high levels of population density which most communities in the rural hillsides of Honduras have not yet reached. Finally, given the limited coverage of basic public services such as public health, education, electricity, communication facilities and extension services in many hillside regions, it is imperative to substantially increase the low current levels of public expenditures in these areas. Subsequent research based on detailed household and plot level data from the same communities suggests that investments geared towards improved access to land, education, market access and extension with a focus on soil fertility maintenance have particular potential to raise incomes.","|MA|","|019-013-340|",,"10.1016/j.agsy.2005.06.005","|",". jansen h g p rodriguez a damon a pender j chenier j schipper r determinants of income earning strategies and adoption of conservation practices in hillside communities in rural honduras agricultural systems elsevier science ltd uk based on the results of participatory diagnostic surveys conducted in 95 rural communities in the hillsides of honduras we determine income earning strategies at the community level; identify their main determinants; and analyze the adoption of of conservation practices eight income earning strategies were distinguished that reflect differences in comparative advantage between communities we explain the choice of income earning strategy using a multinomial logit model that includes biophysical economic social and institutional variables we use a probit model to show that adoption of conservation practices is determined by the type of income earning strategy population density market access and organizational variables our results have some important policy implications first given the higher profitability of cash crops compared to staple foods significant investments in road infrastructure are needed to better integrate hillside communities into the market economy second while the potential of profitable conservation practices depends on the type of income earning strategy pursued population density market access and assistance from community based and external organizations play an important role as well the positive impact of population density on the adoption of many conservation technologies and investments becomes only effective at relatively high levels of population density which most communities in the rural hillsides of honduras have not yet reached finally given the limited coverage of basic public services such as public health education electricity communication facilities and extension services in many hillside regions it is imperative to substantially increase the low current levels of public expenditures in these areas subsequent research based on detailed household and plot level data from the same communities suggests that investments geared towards improved access to land education market access and extension with a focus on soil fertility maintenance have particular potential to raise incomes doi 10 1016 j agsy 2005 06 005 .",,

Opinion-makers perceive parks as representing elite special interest, constraining economic development and/or indigenous rights. We asked what was the original intention and who were the players behind the Netherlands Indies colonial government policy of establishing nature 'monuments' and wildlife sanctuaries. Based on a review of international conservation literature, three inter-related themes are explored: a) the emergence in the 1860-1910 period of new worldviews on the human-nature relationship in western culture; b) the emergence of new conservation values and the translation of these into public policy goals, namely designation of protected areas and enforcement of wildlife legislation, by international lobbying networks of prominent men; and 3) the adoption of these policies by the Netherlands Indies government. This paper provides evidence that the root motivations of protected area policy are noble, namely: 1) a desire to preserve sites with special meaning for intellectual and aesthetic contemplation of nature; and 2) acceptance that the human conquest of nature carries with it a moral responsibility to ensure the survival of threatened life forms. Although these perspectives derive from elite society of the American East Coast and Western Europe at the end of the nineteenth century, they are international values to which civilised nations and societies aspire. It would be a tragedy if Indonesia rejects these social values and protected areas because subsequent management polices have associated protected areas with aspects of the colonial and New Order regime that contemporary society seeks to reform.","|PA|IR|","|142-035-360|","http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/eh/2002/00000008/00000002/art00001",,"|",". jepson p whittaker r j histories of protected areas internationalisation of conservationist values and their adoption in the netherlands indies indonesia environment and history white horse press national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are under threat both physically and as a social ideal in indonesia following the collapse of the suharto new order regime 1967 1998 opinion makers perceive parks as representing elite special interest constraining economic development and or indigenous rights we asked what was the original intention and who were the players behind the netherlands indies colonial government policy of establishing nature monuments and wildlife sanctuaries based on a review of international conservation literature three inter related themes are explored a the emergence in the 1860 1910 period of new worldviews on the human nature relationship in western culture; b the emergence of new conservation values and the translation of these into public policy goals namely designation of protected areas and enforcement of wildlife legislation by international lobbying networks of prominent men; and 3 the adoption of these policies by the netherlands indies government this paper provides evidence that the root motivations of protected area policy are noble namely 1 a desire to preserve sites with special meaning for intellectual and aesthetic contemplation of nature; and 2 acceptance that the human conquest of nature carries with it a moral responsibility to ensure the survival of threatened life forms although these perspectives derive from elite society of the american east coast and western europe at the end of the nineteenth century they are international values to which civilised nations and societies aspire it would be a tragedy if indonesia rejects these social values and protected areas because subsequent management polices have associated protected areas with aspects of the colonial and new order regime that contemporary society seeks to reform http www ingentaconnect com content whp eh 2002 00000008 00000002 art00001 .",,

Individuals, it is argued, are more likely to overcome problems of malfeasance and free-riding when they share an interest in new institutional arrangements and where there exists a legacy of successful co-operation. A contradictory position argues that individuals will ignore, or fail to implement, rules of resource conservation when the stakes of survival are most extreme. Implicit here is the assertion that the costs and risks of survival are so great that they preclude participation in all but the most vital forms of social interaction. This paper considers these debates by exploring the conditions under which villagers in Southern Thailand implemented and enforced rules of restricted access in a traditional inshore fishery.

This is being done in order to provide marketable products from farms that will generate cash for resource-poor rural and peri-urban households. This poverty-alleviating agroforestry strategy is at the same time linked to one in which perennial, biologically diverse and complex mature-stage agroecosystems are developed as sustainable alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture.<BR>One important component of this approach is the domestication of the local tree species that have commercial potential in local, regional or even international markets. Because of the number of potential candidate species for domestication, one crucial first step is the identification of priority species and the formulation of a domestication strategy that is appropriate to the use, marketability and genetic potential of each species.<BR>For most of these hitherto wild species little or no formal research has been carried out to assess their food value, potential for genetic improvement or reproductive biology. To date their marketability can only be assessed by their position in the local rural and urban marketplaces, since few have attracted international commercial interest. To meet the objective of poverty alleviation, however, it is crucial that market expansion and creation are possible, hence for example it is important to determine which marketable traits are amenable to genetic improvement.

This seems due both to the poor performance of earlier projects-which prompted a more risk-adverse Bank strategy following the intense international scrutiny and criticism contributing to the cautious approach urged by the 1991 Forest Strategy-and to a lack of demand in Brazil for Bank funds. Brazil ' s macroeconomic difficulties-its balance of payments and fiscal deficits-have led the government to be selective as well as to shift lending to quick-disbursing activities. This is evident in the most recent land reform programs. Controlling deforestation is not easy given the large number and level of national and global forces and actors affecting it. If the Bank is to be a facilitator for balancing the needs of stakeholders (i.e., the poor and the indigenous people) and national and global interests, it must be seen as an objective bystander.

In the two villages where the author conducted fieldwork (1990-1994), Mamire and Mutuka, in Babati District, in the southwestern part of the Arusha region in northern Tanzania, physical conditions for agriculture are excellent. Most households have access to land. In spite of this, a large number of households are unable to survive on agriculture alone. Also, in most fields the productivity of the soil is rapidly decreasing. Few measures are taken to counteract this process. The results of the author's field studies of the social conditions of land use showed that a substantial part of the households lacked resources to invest in soil productivity improvements. Ploughing of the fields was identified as a threshold where many households entered a downward circle of poverty.

Following the 1992 World Parks Congress, a new system of categorizing protected areas was developed. New categories were introduced, including categories that allowed resource extraction. Since that time there has been rapid growth in the global numbers and size of protected areas, with most growth being shown in the new categories. Further-more, the IUCN has heralded a [lsquo ]new paradigm[rsquo ] of protected areas, which became the main focus of the 2003 World Parks Congress. The paradigm focuses on benefits to local people to alleviate poverty, re-engineering protected areas professionals, and an emphasis on the interaction between humans and nature through a focus on the new IUCN protected area categories.The purpose of this paper is to examine critically the implications of the new categories and paradigm shift in light of the main purpose of protected areas, to protect wild biodiversity. Wild biodiversity will not be well served by adoption of this new paradigm, which will devalue conservation biology, undermine the creation of more strictly protected reserves, inflate the amount of area in reserves and place people at the centre of the protected area agenda at the expense of wild biodiversity. Only IUCN categories I[ndash ]IV should be recognized as protected areas. The new categories, namely culturally modified landscapes (V) and managed resource areas (VI), should be reclassified as sustainable development areas. To do so would better serve both the protection of wild biodiversity and those seeking to meet human needs on humanized landscapes where sustainable development is practised.","|PA|","|","Cambridge University Press<BR>Phone: +44 (0)1223 326070<BR>Email: journals@cambridge.org",,"|O0302/CON|O0293/OPE|",". locke h dearden p rethinking protected area categories and the new paradigm environmental conservation cambridge university press cambridge uk the world conservation union iucn plays a global leadership role in defining different types of protected areas and influencing how protected area systems develop and are managed following the 1992 world parks congress a new system of categorizing protected areas was developed new categories were introduced including categories that allowed resource extraction since that time there has been rapid growth in the global numbers and size of protected areas with most growth being shown in the new categories further more the iucn has heralded a lsquo new paradigm rsquo of protected areas which became the main focus of the 2003 world parks congress the paradigm focuses on benefits to local people to alleviate poverty re engineering protected areas professionals and an emphasis on the interaction between humans and nature through a focus on the new iucn protected area categories the purpose of this paper is to examine critically the implications of the new categories and paradigm shift in light of the main purpose of protected areas to protect wild biodiversity wild biodiversity will not be well served by adoption of this new paradigm which will devalue conservation biology undermine the creation of more strictly protected reserves inflate the amount of area in reserves and place people at the centre of the protected area agenda at the expense of wild biodiversity only iucn categories i ndash iv should be recognized as protected areas the new categories namely culturally modified landscapes v and managed resource areas vi should be reclassified as sustainable development areas to do so would better serve both the protection of wild biodiversity and those seeking to meet human needs on humanized landscapes where sustainable development is practised cambridge university press phone 44 0 1223 326070 email journals cambridge org o0302 co o0293 ac .",,

Secondly, some underlying causes of deforestation are examined. While caution is needed about many conventional hypotheses, there are strong reasons to believe that higher rural wages generated by greater off-farm employment opportunities reduce deforestation. Thirdly, an empirical analysis indicates that agricultural activities in rural areas remain closely tied to deforestation because of the virtual absence of non-environmental assets of the poor. And finally, some doubts are placed on the excessive establishment of Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs) within the countryside. In particular, the paper concludes that for the case of Guatemala strengthening the rural non-farm sector and human capital formation should be regarded as a key elements of a development strategy that tries to combine biodiversity conservation within a framework of sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation.","|Fo|IR|","|019-013-320|","http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=379984",,"|",". loening j l markussen m poverty deforestation and biodiversity loss in guatemala ibero america institute for economic research discussion paper this paper explores the causes of deforestation and biodiversity loss in guatemala and is organized into 4 parts first an overview about deforestation in guatemala from 1950 2000 is provided and the relationship between deforestation and biodiversity loss is explored secondly some underlying causes of deforestation are examined while caution is needed about many conventional hypotheses there are strong reasons to believe that higher rural wages generated by greater off farm employment opportunities reduce deforestation thirdly an empirical analysis indicates that agricultural activities in rural areas remain closely tied to deforestation because of the virtual absence of non environmental assets of the poor and finally some doubts are placed on the excessive establishment of integrated conservation and development projects icdps within the countryside in particular the paper concludes that for the case of guatemala strengthening the rural non farm sector and human capital formation should be regarded as a key elements of a development strategy that tries to combine biodiversity conservation within a framework of sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation http papers ssrn com sol3 papers cfm abstract_id=379984 .",,

In this paper, we assess two important elements of CAMPFIRE: poverty alleviation and local empowerment and comment on the program's performance in achieving these highly interconnected objectives. We analyze the program's achievements in poverty alleviation by exploring tenurial patterns, resource ownership and the allocation of proceeds from resource exploitation; and its progress in local empowerment by examining its administrative and decision making structures.

The success of these strategies hinges on, first, the successful creation or expansion of target markets and, second, the beneficial involvement of local stakeholders in these markets so that improved incentives induce conservation. This paper evaluates these two key elements in the case of argan oil commercialization in southwestern Morocco. The principal finding is that even when locals appear well-positioned to reap ex post benefits, one can reject the hypothesis that successful resource commercialization necessarily stimulates local development and reduces poverty. Most locals participate only superficially in the new and expanded markets for argan oil, and the benefits that do trickle down to local households appear to be regressively distributed, both regionally and between households. The key lies in understanding how opening or expanding markets may induce endogenous product differentiation that easily excludes locals, especially the poor, and how ex ante market access—a variable commonly correlated with wealth—conditions households’ capacity to participate in market-induced producer windfalls.","|MA|","|002-015-504|",,"10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00020-4","|",". lybbert t j barrett c b narjisse h market based conservation and local benefits the case of argan oil in morocco ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk market based approaches to biodiversity conservation gained popularity in the 1990s the success of these strategies hinges on first the successful creation or expansion of target markets and second the beneficial involvement of local stakeholders in these markets so that improved incentives induce conservation this paper evaluates these two key elements in the case of argan oil commercialization in southwestern morocco the principal finding is that even when locals appear well positioned to reap ex post benefits one can reject the hypothesis that successful resource commercialization necessarily stimulates local development and reduces poverty most locals participate only superficially in the new and expanded markets for argan oil and the benefits that do trickle down to local households appear to be regressively distributed both regionally and between households the key lies in understanding how opening or expanding markets may induce endogenous product differentiation that easily excludes locals especially the poor and how ex ante market access—a variable commonly correlated with wealth—conditions households’ capacity to participate in market induced producer windfalls doi 10 1016 s0921 8009 02 00020 4 .",,

Technological innovations, institutional developments, and family planning are key inputs. Development should shift to a focus on elimination of widespread poverty. Past development strategies in an African context of ample resources have harmed the environment without improving the average person's standard of living. Knowledge about Africa's environment and environmental degradation is inadequate. Recent studies have found, contrary to popular belief, that small shareholders made considerable investments in resource-based capital, which protected their farms from major environmental deterioration and negative impacts of intensification. In Nigeria field studies found that rising demand for fuelwood did not lead to greater deforestation or desertification. Severe degradation has occurred in places where density of population is greater than 500 persons per sq. km, where the land is physically or biologically vulnerable, and where socioeconomic conditions interfere with application of conservation measures. Reduced well-being and reduced food capacity is attributed to land tenure arrangements, misguided macroeconomic policies, and inadequate infrastructure. The issues of development, environment, and population are complex. Sustainable development is possible with appropriate investment priorities that will provide needed infrastructure, services, and education. Urban areas need safe water, solid waste disposal, and spatial planning to relieve congested spaces. Rural areas should focus on health education and basic sanitation.

In this paper we examine the effects of papyrus harvesting and swamp reclamation on the net present value of papyrus swamps fringing Lake Bunyonyi in southwest Uganda. The value of harvested papyrus, crops and fish obtained from the swamp was modelled in relation to swamp area, using a production function approach. Parameter values were estimated from interview data. Results indicated that the net present value of swamps was maximised when between 27-33% of the swamp is utilised for harvesting, but when optimal cultivation levels were less than 2%. These findings lend support to the premise that conserving biodiversity has an economic basis. Assuming a 5% discount rate, the maximum net present value of goods derived from the swamps were estimated at between US$11.2 thousand ha-1 and US$24.0 thousand ha-1, depending on the method used to measure value. Relative to potential global benefits of papyrus ecosystems through, for example, carbon sequestration, these values are relatively small. Potential conflicts between the interests of local people and the international community are therefore discussed. The optimal ratio of harvesting, cultivation and conservation is comparatively robust to most model parameter estimates. However, a reduction in wages or the perceived value of people’s time, leads to a large increase in optimal levels of harvesting and cultivation, trapping people into a vicious circle of poverty. These results are discussed in relation to wetland policy in Uganda.","|MA|","|002-014-800|","http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/cserge/pub/wp/ecm/ecm_2003_10.pdf",,"|O0265/OPE|",". maclean i m d tinch r hassall m boar r towards an optimal use of tropical wetlands an economic valuation of goods derived from papyrus swamps in southwest uganda center for social and economic research on the global environment university of east anglia norwich wetlands in uganda have undergone considerable decline over the last thirty years as a result of clearance for agriculture and over use of wetland resources in this paper we examine the effects of papyrus harvesting and swamp reclamation on the net present value of papyrus swamps fringing lake bunyonyi in southwest uganda the value of harvested papyrus crops and fish obtained from the swamp was modelled in relation to swamp area using a production function approach parameter values were estimated from interview data results indicated that the net present value of swamps was maximised when between 27 33% of the swamp is utilised for harvesting but when optimal cultivation levels were less than 2% these findings lend support to the premise that conserving biodiversity has an economic basis assuming a 5% discount rate the maximum net present value of goods derived from the swamps were estimated at between us$11 2 thousand ha 1 and us$24 0 thousand ha 1 depending on the method used to measure value relative to potential global benefits of papyrus ecosystems through for example carbon sequestration these values are relatively small potential conflicts between the interests of local people and the international community are therefore discussed the optimal ratio of harvesting cultivation and conservation is comparatively robust to most model parameter estimates however a reduction in wages or the perceived value of people’s time leads to a large increase in optimal levels of harvesting and cultivation trapping people into a vicious circle of poverty these results are discussed in relation to wetland policy in uganda http www uea ac uk env cserge pub wp ecm ecm_2003_10 pdf o0265 ac .",,

It documents the approach taken in designing and implementing a research project that would contribute to the increased understanding of different needs of both women and men involved in NTFP commercialisation. It acknowledges that for poverty reduction to be effective, the many varied and important roles of women, including their contribution to household income generation through the use and management of natural resources, need to be recognised. Gender discrimination is globally the most widespread form of social exclusion, and this inequality is a key obstacle to development.

In recent years there has been a marked shift from an emphasis on the notion of the ‘sustainability’ of socio-ecological systems to a focus on the notion of the ‘resilience’ of the ecosystem, and people’s capacity to diversify their livelihoods to facilitate the ecosystem’s recovery from shocks and stresses. Linkages between poverty and environmentally sustainable development are often dependent on how poverty is defined, the environmental problem in question, and the groups among the poor that are affected by environmental change/degradation in the context of uneven development. The causes of poverty and environmental degradation are structured by this uneven process of development operating via technologies, incentives and institutions and regulations which favour some. The broadening of conventional poverty measurements (income/consumption flows) to include other dimensions of poverty such entitlements and vulnerability is changing the way linkages between poverty-environment are viewed. Much of the mainstream literature on environmentally sustainable development has ignored the gender dimensions. In the instances where there has been specific attention to women, they have been viewed as naturally privileged managers of environmental resources with little attention paid to how gender relations systematically differentiate poor men and women in processes of production and reproduction and relegate women to environmentally-based activities and limit their access to other types of livelihood activity. More recently, linkages between gender, poverty and the environment are increasingly discussed. A gender analysis is increasingly seen as important because: experiences of poverty and environmental change are gender-differentiated; environmental security is mediated by gender relations; and women and men have both conflicting and complementary interests and roles in environmental management. There are significant differences between women’s and men’s experience of poverty and environmental change because of gender inequalities in access to environmental resources, for example: land and common property resources; command over labour, e.g. allocation of labour time; capacity to diversify livelihood strategies, e.g. accumulating savings and market oriented activities; and decision-making powers. This implies that there is a need to widen the range of choices available to poor men and women taking into consideration gendered differences in rights over land and resources to enhance environmentally sustainable development. Effective natural resources management requires participatory approaches that take into account the different activities of household members, the impact of their different uses of natural resources on the environment, and the gendered interests and incentives for natural resource management. It is clear that more detailed research is required to establish the links between gender and environmental management in different contexts.","|PE|","|","Publications Office IDS<BR>Phone: 01273 678269<BR>Email: G.Edwards@ids.ac.uk",,"|O0037/OPE|",". masika r joekes s environmentally sustainable development and poverty a gender analysis bridge reports institute of development studies brighton there is much debate over how to define the term environmentally sustainable development with many definitions emphasising some or many of the economic political social and ecological dimensions associated with the term in recent years there has been a marked shift from an emphasis on the notion of the ‘sustainability’ of socio ecological systems to a focus on the notion of the ‘resilience’ of the ecosystem and people’s capacity to diversify their livelihoods to facilitate the ecosystem’s recovery from shocks and stresses linkages between poverty and environmentally sustainable development are often dependent on how poverty is defined the environmental problem in question and the groups among the poor that are affected by environmental change degradation in the context of uneven development the causes of poverty and environmental degradation are structured by this uneven process of development operating via technologies incentives and institutions and regulations which favour some the broadening of conventional poverty measurements income consumption flows to include other dimensions of poverty such entitlements and vulnerability is changing the way linkages between poverty environment are viewed much of the mainstream literature on environmentally sustainable development has ignored the gender dimensions in the instances where there has been specific attention to women they have been viewed as naturally privileged managers of environmental resources with little attention paid to how gender relations systematically differentiate poor men and women in processes of production and reproduction and relegate women to environmentally based activities and limit their access to other types of livelihood activity more recently linkages between gender poverty and the environment are increasingly discussed a gender analysis is increasingly seen as important because experiences of poverty and environmental change are gender differentiated; environmental security is mediated by gender relations; and women and men have both conflicting and complementary interests and roles in environmental management there are significant differences between women’s and men’s experience of poverty and environmental change because of gender inequalities in access to environmental resources for example land and common property resources; command over labour e g allocation of labour time; capacity to diversify livelihood strategies e g accumulating savings and market oriented activities; and decision making powers this implies that there is a need to widen the range of choices available to poor men and women taking into consideration gendered differences in rights over land and resources to enhance environmentally sustainable development effective natural resources management requires participatory approaches that take into account the different activities of household members the impact of their different uses of natural resources on the environment and the gendered interests and incentives for natural resource management it is clear that more detailed research is required to establish the links between gender and environmental management in different contexts publications office ids phone 01273 678269 email g edwards ids ac uk o0037 ac .",,

It is increasingly clear that these protected areas have limited future prospects without the cooperation and support of local people, especially in developing countries. Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs) set out to reconcile park management with local needs and aspirations—by emphasizing social and economic development among local communities—and have managed to attract the lion’s share of the funding for biodiversity. But so far the results have been disappointing. Important unanswered questions remain, and there is little consensus on when or where an ICDP approach to protected area management is appropriate and likely to be effective. Some conservationists argue that the ICDP focus on development dilutes biodiversity conservation goals, whereas others argue that the inward-looking protectionist alternative is doomed to failure. As the struggle to balance conservation and development continues, the need to evaluate what works and what doesn’t becomes increasingly important. This book draws on the lessons from the ICDP experience to inform the next generation of biodiversity conservation programs, including those concerned with the alleviation of poverty as well as those working at landscape scale.

We found that natural vegetative strips provide a simple solution to the technical constraints of soil conservation on slopes. These are buffer strips, laid out on the contour, in which natural vegetation is allowed to re-grow into a thick, protective cover. The strips also provide a foundation for developing more complex agroforestry systems including fodder, fruit, and timber trees. The tremendous surge in adoption of these systems has been enhanced by the Landcare approach. Landcare is a movement of farmer-led organisations that share knowledge about sustainable and profitable agriculture on the sloping lands while conserving the natural resources.

More recently, urban residents and other wildlife stakeholders are increasingly experiencing wildlife damage. The phrases 'animal damage control', 'problem wildlife management', and 'wildlife damage management' have been traditionally used to describe actions taken to reduce economic losses to agricultural produce caused by wildlife. More recently, the phrase 'human-wildlife conflict management' is being applied to these and other situations that involve any negative interactions between humans and wildlife. These conflicts can be either real or perceived, economic or aesthetic, social or political. Human-wildlife conflicts also may encompass damages to the individual that result from federal, state, or local wildlife legislation, regulations, or policies that are designed to protect or conserve wildlife, public benefits, and individual property rights.

Strategies for reducing poverty have begun to pay more attention to the relationship between environmental degradation and poverty. This two-way relationship is a significant one. Environmental degradation contributes to poverty through worsened health and by constraining the productivity of those resources upon which the poor rely, and poverty restricts the poor to act in ways that are damaging to the environment. In addition, demographic factors can be involved in complex ways; high growth rates are associated with poverty, and directly exacerbate problems of environmental degradation. This paper will address several of the links among poverty, population, and the environment. It first addresses the impact of environmental degradation on the poor ' s health and productivity. Next, it analyzes the proposition that the poor have short horizons, the circumstances that contribute to this, and the consequences for the environment. The impact of population dynamics on the environment is considered in terms of three dimensions: scale, rate of growth, and migration.

The current case study has tried to translate these results into economic values through cost-benefit analyses and describe their impacts on local livelihoods and eco-systems through the voices of local people, local leaders and relevant organizations at district, provincial and national levels. The case study showed that the sustainable harvesting regimes played a major role in reducing poverty and sustaining local livelihoods, while providing villagers with enduring incentives and adequate capacities to manage village forests.

It appeared necessary, therefore, for states and international organizations to intervene. Because poverty was identified with production constraints, such interventions took the form of technological transfer in agriculture. Later, as agro-ecological constraints became more widely perceived, and supposedly \"fragile\" ecosystems were believed to be under threat from population growth and other factors, emphasis shifted to \"environmental sustainability\". As with the new technologies, so with sustainable natural resource management, it was often assumed that the new knowledge must come from outside, or from \"science\", and must be promoted against the natural \"conservatism\" of smallholders by whatever means necessary--from coercion at one extreme to \"participation\" at the other. Recently there has been much movement away from such stereotypical positions towards more subtle and varied statements of the problem. However, I believe there is still a lacuna with respect to the autonomy of the smallholder in the \"fight against poverty\". Intervention is still the name of the game, and receives far more attention than the resources or achievements of poor people themselves. Analyses of long-term trends in the management of resources at the village, regional and national levels in dryland Africa suggest that African farmers have made considerable achievements in the face of a trying environment. An understanding of this long-term trend may provide a better framework for the diagnosis of current problems and the formulation of future policy on poverty and livelihoods in the drylands.","|Ag|","|","Taylor & Francis Journals (UK)<BR>Phone: +44 (0)20 7017 6000<BR>Email: beverley.acreman@tandf.co.uk",,"|",". mortimore m long term change in african drylands can recent history point towards development pathways oxford development studies taylor and francis the problem of poverty in africa was often discussed in terms of the agro ecological specifics and the internal social relations of societies production systems and economies it appeared necessary therefore for states and international organizations to intervene because poverty was identified with production constraints such interventions took the form of technological transfer in agriculture later as agro ecological constraints became more widely perceived and supposedly fragile ecosystems were believed to be under threat from population growth and other factors emphasis shifted to environmental sustainability as with the new technologies so with sustainable natural resource management it was often assumed that the new knowledge must come from outside or from science and must be promoted against the natural conservatism of smallholders by whatever means necessary from coercion at one extreme to participation at the other recently there has been much movement away from such stereotypical positions towards more subtle and varied statements of the problem however i believe there is still a lacuna with respect to the autonomy of the smallholder in the fight against poverty intervention is still the name of the game and receives far more attention than the resources or achievements of poor people themselves analyses of long term trends in the management of resources at the village regional and national levels in dryland africa suggest that african farmers have made considerable achievements in the face of a trying environment an understanding of this long term trend may provide a better framework for the diagnosis of current problems and the formulation of future policy on poverty and livelihoods in the drylands taylor & francis journals uk phone 44 0 20 7017 6000 email beverley acreman tandf co uk .",,

The poor, it is suggested, have a higher rate of time preference because they are more concerned about present survival than they are about saving for the future. Such thinking is also central to the economic growth for environmental conservation and the poverty induced environmental degradation arguments. According to these assertions, wealth allows people to consider the future and invest in environmental conservation; and poverty leaves people with no alternative but to exploit the environment so that they may feed their families today. Evidence from the food security and famine early warning fields suggests that households in many African contexts behave quite to the contrary. During periods of food shortage, poor households will often undertake extreme measures in the present, including depriving the family of needed calories, in order to preserve productive capital for the future, such as a plough, oxen or seed stock. This evidence suggests that poor African households may, in fact, have very low rates of time preference. This calls into question our general assumptions about discount rates for developing countries, for which rates of time preference are a theoretical determinant.","|MA|","|002--|","http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/09218009/2001/00000038/00000003/art00184",,"|O0233/OPE|",". moseley w g african evidence on the relation of poverty time preference and the environment ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk it is typically argued in the economics literature that the poor operate with a higher rate of time preference than their wealthier counterparts the poor it is suggested have a higher rate of time preference because they are more concerned about present survival than they are about saving for the future such thinking is also central to the economic growth for environmental conservation and the poverty induced environmental degradation arguments according to these assertions wealth allows people to consider the future and invest in environmental conservation; and poverty leaves people with no alternative but to exploit the environment so that they may feed their families today evidence from the food security and famine early warning fields suggests that households in many african contexts behave quite to the contrary during periods of food shortage poor households will often undertake extreme measures in the present including depriving the family of needed calories in order to preserve productive capital for the future such as a plough oxen or seed stock this evidence suggests that poor african households may in fact have very low rates of time preference this calls into question our general assumptions about discount rates for developing countries for which rates of time preference are a theoretical determinant http www ingentaconnect com content els 09218009 2001 00000038 00000003 art00184 o0233 ac .",,

Contrary to popular belief, drylands are not parched wastelands, but contain a high degree of natural and social diversity. The dryland soils are believed to be degrading, and continuous exposures to frequent droughts coupled with political and economic marginalisation are putting poor people living in the drylands at risk. To be able to appreciate the complexities of the current problems, it is necessary to review the historical debates and discourses, surrounding the ideas of desertification and degradation. Furthermore, in order to enable critical appraisal of these narratives and the assumptions on which they rest, it is essential to have a sound understanding of key ecological concepts. More nuanced explanations are offered regarding the relationships between population, poverty, and environmental degradation. Different approaches towards tackling the problems in the drylands are discussed, with specific attention to the case of pastoralism. The paper then turns to describing and discussing the efforts of the Convention to Combat Desertification to implement policies and practices conducive to preventing degradation in the drylands. The authors emphasise that the focus should be shifted from an emphasis on the environment to an emphasis on the people living in that environment.

Consequently, there is a new moral geography wherein parks and protected areas have become spaces of deadly violence. This article seeks to understand the moral justification for shoot-on-sight protocols in African biodiversity protection and examine the ramifications for the overall level of violence in national parks. It builds on and extends the political ecology analysis of violence and justice through an engagement with the environmental ethics literature. It concludes that a moral justification for shoot on sight and wartime violence cannot be demonstrated within the various philosophical approaches to environmental ethics. Yet wartime ethics and shoot on sight have become taken for granted in Africa. The article posits that discursive analysis can elucidate why this is so. Through a careful analysis of popular media it shows how key identities are discursively constructed to radically reorder the moral standing of African poachers and wild animals. These discursively constructed identities operate to simultaneously humanize wild animals and denigrate poachers, including impoverished peasants searching for small game or fish.

Second, if the state alienates their development rights in the name of conservation, then to what extent should the state compensate the Maasai for their lost economic opportunities. To the Maasai, conservation as implemented through Government policy is a publicc bad: they are denied access to resources, their costs of production are significantly increased, and development is slowed down or actively discouraged.

The potential utility and limitations of six low-input interventions to help forestall further genetic erosion in the region are discussed, with a focus on local community involvement. Improved agroforestry systems may help reduce deforestation by increasing farm productivity, although methods to increase the currently low adoption rate of these technologies need to be developed. Use of strategic tree domestication techniques can also improve farm productivity and prevent inadvertent genetic drift and inbreeding associated with traditional domestication practices, although to have a major impact, current programs need to be extended across the region. Woodlot forestry could supplant selective extraction of timber and offers an attractive opportunity for poverty alleviation if appropriate credit and land tenure policies can be developed. However, it may also result in increased deforestation if activities on public land cannot be controlled. The implementation of improved seed collection systems and simple seed transfer guidelines would help to reduce the collection of seed of poor quality and low genetic diversity, and avoid maladapted plantings, although such programs are difficult to monitor and seed costs may increase.

The continent was populated by many nations, functioned in harmony with nature, had a variety of cultures and languages, and, developed many different socio-economic systems (nationally and locally). These nations were sovereign and recognized from Alaska to Patagonia. Indeed, among all of them, we know they had very advanced, and well established institutional arrangements and organizations (formal and informal), created and nurtured with the view to respond to the needs, and challenges of the time. With a variety of forms of governance, these societies did assign rights, and responsibilities to the different actors, and groups in order to maintain an acceptable level of social cohesion, to establish important political consensus. As the political systems of some countries are now becoming more democratic to listening, and embracing the views of minorities, issues of land rights have clearly surfaced. Issues of sovereignty, customary law and, simply, of traditional norms-from the national to the household levels-are being put on the table of what is clearly a complex social dialogue. The paper is an excellent source of basic information, sharing an easy and practical understanding about land tenure/titling, as discussed above.

A critical dimension of these systems concerns their impact on the poor. This paper reviews the main linkages that have been hypothesized to exist between PES systems and poverty, drawing on data from the main on-going and planned PES systems in Latin America, and particularly on those supported by the World Bank. The main poverty-reduction impact of PES is likely to come from payments made to often poor natural resource managers in upper watersheds. The extent to which this will occur depends on how many potential participants in PES programs are in fact poor, and on the amount of the payments. There are, however, also some potential threats. Dealing with many small, poor land users can impose high transaction costs, thus threatening to cut the poor off from participating in PES systems. Careful design of the system is needed to avoid this problem, as in Costa Rica’s development of collective contracting mechanisms to reduce transaction costs. Where property rights are insecure, the poor who depend on forests and other natural ecosystems for their livelihood may be displaced as PES increases the value of those ecosystems. This seems to have been an issue in Colombia’s Cauca Valley, for example. The landless poor may find themselves affected, either positively or negatively, by labor market and other changes induced by the establishment of PES systems (for example, they may be harmed if the conservation practices encouraged by PES systems are less labor intensive than the practices they replace). It is in many cases too early to provide conclusive answers to these questions.

Each approach has its uses and its limitations. Understanding under what conditions one approach should be used rather than another is critical: the answer obtained under one approach, no matter how well conducted, is generally meaningless when applied to problems that are better treated using another approach.

Both income (GDP/capita) and Human Development Index as national poverty measures are regressed with relative forest area as a dependant variable, and with population density, Corruption Perception Index and some other independent variables in 35-83 tropical countries covering 70-95 % of the total tropical forest area. It was found that the two poverty variables were strongly correlated with the relative forest area. It was deduced that high population density at low income levels advances forest degradation, deforestation and desertification. The deteriorated forest environment as human habitat increases poverty, which in turn increases population pressure on the remaining forest, and so on in a vicious circle. The prevailing practice of administrative pricing of the standing timber undervalues the tropical forest. Therefore, the opportunity cost of sustainable forestry remains artificially too high and is expanding deforestation with corruption and some other causes underlying the local visible agents of deforestation. The widely prevailing corruption in the tropics is blocking the effectiveness of both the government policies and the market means, which are the only ways to control the allocation, production and distribution of forest products and services. Finland never had any wide scale corruption and it has therefore had less government and market failures than the tropical countries. In Finland increasing exports of forest products have made forestry more profitable and agricultural fields more productive and they have in this way reduced poverty in a national scale. In the tropics increasing exports have advanced deforestation with minimal impacts in poverty reduction. Finland, Costa Rica, Republic of Korea, Sweden and Japan all have transited into sustainable forestry practices. They all share prevailing private forest ownership and advanced political, social, human, financial, natural and physical capitals, while most of the tropical countries are lacking such endowments as a balanced mix. Therefore, poverty reduction in a national scale by the tropical forests will remain as rhetoric for the time being. It may become a viable option only in a couple of decades with reducing corruption and a major devolution of the prevailing socialistic forestry.","|Fo|","|","http://www.metla.fi/pp/MPal/PovertyReduction-paper-palo-October2003.htm",,"|O0245/OPE|",". palo m poverty reduction by tropical forests rhetoric or a viable option this paper is aimed to respond to the most essential issue raised in its title both income gdp capita and human development index as national poverty measures are regressed with relative forest area as a dependant variable and with population density corruption perception index and some other independent variables in 35 83 tropical countries covering 70 95 % of the total tropical forest area it was found that the two poverty variables were strongly correlated with the relative forest area it was deduced that high population density at low income levels advances forest degradation deforestation and desertification the deteriorated forest environment as human habitat increases poverty which in turn increases population pressure on the remaining forest and so on in a vicious circle the prevailing practice of administrative pricing of the standing timber undervalues the tropical forest therefore the opportunity cost of sustainable forestry remains artificially too high and is expanding deforestation with corruption and some other causes underlying the local visible agents of deforestation the widely prevailing corruption in the tropics is blocking the effectiveness of both the government policies and the market means which are the only ways to control the allocation production and distribution of forest products and services finland never had any wide scale corruption and it has therefore had less government and market failures than the tropical countries in finland increasing exports of forest products have made forestry more profitable and agricultural fields more productive and they have in this way reduced poverty in a national scale in the tropics increasing exports have advanced deforestation with minimal impacts in poverty reduction finland costa rica republic of korea sweden and japan all have transited into sustainable forestry practices they all share prevailing private forest ownership and advanced political social human financial natural and physical capitals while most of the tropical countries are lacking such endowments as a balanced mix therefore poverty reduction in a national scale by the tropical forests will remain as rhetoric for the time being it may become a viable option only in a couple of decades with reducing corruption and a major devolution of the prevailing socialistic forestry http www metla fi pp mpal povertyreduction paper palo october2003 htm o0245 ac .",,

Imputing economic values to nonmarketed benefits has the potential to change radically the way we look at all forests and to make the pendulum swing back from a presumption in favor of forest conversion to more conservation and sustainable use. This paper surveys what we know about forest economic values and draws policy conclusions from the now substantial literature that values nonmarket benefits of forests. Estimating economic values is not enough. The subsequent stage of policy is to design markets that capture the values'market creation'ideally for the benefit of the many vulnerable communities that rely on the forests for their well-being. These conclusions support the wider argument for using effective economic instruments to promote conservation of the remaining forests.

In its broadest sense, resilience is a measure of the ability of a system to withstand stresses and shocks – its ability to persist in an uncertain world. For many policy-makers, however, the concern that desirable states or processes may not be ‘sustainable’ is balanced by the concern that individuals and societies may get ‘locked-in’ to undesirable states or processes.

To most people the biodiversity loss that matters is not the global extinction of species, but the effects of local change in flora and fauna on watershed protection, soil conservation, habitat, productivity and amenity. For this reason, biodiversity conservation concerns even the poorest communities.

Demands for land reform, poverty alleviation and job creation have all had profound implications for the conservation and management of the nation's protected areas. An attitudinal study was conducted within three diverse South African communities, and among employees of the Kwa Zulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service (KZN Wildlife) to assess how the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park (GSWP) and the authorities charged with its management are perceived in the context of post-apartheid South Africa. Despite significant revisions to South Africa's conservation policies in the post-apartheid era, attitudinal research has continued to focus on rural black communities, leaving white residents, urban black populations and the conservation authorities themselves largely under-represented. As a result, the relationships between local communities, protected areas and conservation authorities remain largely unknown and outdated. Qualitative analysis of 90 semi-structured interviews indicated limited support (5%) for the abolition of the GSWP. The potential loss of the GSWP was associated with negative economic (88%) and environmental (66%) impacts by all respondents, regardless of race, gender, age or residency. Contrary to previous research conducted during the apartheid era, an overwhelming majority of Zulu respondents perceived a positive association between nature conservation, tourism and improved local economic welfare. Thus, local attitudes towards protected areas appeared to be improving. There remained however a discrepancy between support for the GSWP and the management authorities, particularly among respondents with limited contact with conservation staff. This is consistent with previous surveys where residents expressed support for the concept of conservation, but significant hostility towards local conservation authorities. The distinction is critical, as negative attitudes towards conservation authorities are often misinterpreted as a lack of support for conservation in general. Local residents (regardless of race or socioeconomic status) also expressed high expectations of KZN Wildlife to address issues of unemployment, poverty and tourism in the region. If these expectations are not met, support for the GSWP, as well as the conservation authorities, is likely to decline dramatically.","|PA|IR|","|002-018-710|","Cambridge University Press<BR>Email: directcustserve@cambridge.org<BR>Phone: +44 (0)1223 326050",,"|O0049/OPE|",". picard c h post apartheid perceptions of the greater st lucia wetland park south africa environmental conservation cambridge university press cambridge uk in the wake of apartheid south african protected areas have come under increasing pressure to reconcile a wealth of natural resources with the acute social and economic needs of the black rural majority demands for land reform poverty alleviation and job creation have all had profound implications for the conservation and management of the nation s protected areas an attitudinal study was conducted within three diverse south african communities and among employees of the kwa zulu natal nature conservation service kzn wildlife to assess how the greater st lucia wetland park gswp and the authorities charged with its management are perceived in the context of post apartheid south africa despite significant revisions to south africa s conservation policies in the post apartheid era attitudinal research has continued to focus on rural black communities leaving white residents urban black populations and the conservation authorities themselves largely under represented as a result the relationships between local communities protected areas and conservation authorities remain largely unknown and outdated qualitative analysis of 90 semi structured interviews indicated limited support 5% for the abolition of the gswp the potential loss of the gswp was associated with negative economic 88% and environmental 66% impacts by all respondents regardless of race gender age or residency contrary to previous research conducted during the apartheid era an overwhelming majority of zulu respondents perceived a positive association between nature conservation tourism and improved local economic welfare thus local attitudes towards protected areas appeared to be improving there remained however a discrepancy between support for the gswp and the management authorities particularly among respondents with limited contact with conservation staff this is consistent with previous surveys where residents expressed support for the concept of conservation but significant hostility towards local conservation authorities the distinction is critical as negative attitudes towards conservation authorities are often misinterpreted as a lack of support for conservation in general local residents regardless of race or socioeconomic status also expressed high expectations of kzn wildlife to address issues of unemployment poverty and tourism in the region if these expectations are not met support for the gswp as well as the conservation authorities is likely to decline dramatically cambridge university press email directcustserve cambridge org phone 44 0 1223 326050 o0049 da .",,

The argument maintains that, mainly due to inherent short time horizons and risk, poverty encourages over-exploitation of the physical environment which results in further impoverishment. Using both conceptual and empirical material, this paper examines some of the major linkages that are believed to exist between the processes of poverty and environmental degradation, with a focus on the Western Himalayan Regions of India - the state of Himachal Pradesh and the hill districts of Uttar Pradesh.

There are still 30 million people living below the absolute poverty line. They are concentrated in the mountainous areas of western China, of which the loess area of Gansu province is one of the driest and poorest. One of the root causes of poverty is water scarcity. Water is the key factor in changing the fundamental conditions for the existence and development of the poor areas. Due to the topographical nature of the area, a major water delivery project would be difficult to build and be economically unfeasible. The most easy-to-use water source with the highest potential is rainwater. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) has been carried out in previous decades and it has been shown that it can serve the poor by supplying water for domestic use and supplemental irrigation, thus ensuring both water and food security. It can create a pre-condition for the modification of agricultural structure, thus promoting income generation. RWH is also beneficial to the recovery of the ecosystem and environmental conservation in the semi-arid northwest region of China. Past experiences show that RWH is an innovative approach for the integrated and sustainable development of the poor areas.

Our prevailing cultural myth includes a dangerous vision of global sustainability and poverty reduction centered on unlimited economic expansion, free trade and technological fixes. This paper dissects the modern myth, exposing its conceptual flaws and practical failings. It then proposes an alternative conceptual framework for development derived from ecological economics and ecological footprint analysis. The new framework recognizes that the human enterprise is a subsystem of the ecosphere whose growth is constrained by biophysical limits. If humanity is to seize control of its destiny it must arise above wishful thinking and tribal instinct. Global society needs a new cultural myth rooted in humanity's unique claim to intelligence and self-awareness in the face of danger. Human security depends on equitable development—not growth—within the means of nature.

They are managed by the national conservation authority according to the terms of a joint management agreement drawn up by a joint management committee usually consisting of representatives from the national conservation authority and the landowners. Since majority rule in 1994, South African contractual national parks have provided a model through which the country's conservation as well as development objectives can be met, particularly where landowners are previously disadvantaged communities. Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu National Parks in Australia were established on Aboriginal-owned land and have over fifteen years of experience in co-management. In view of the growing resurgence of protectionist approaches to conservation, this article assesses the success of contractual national parks in South Africa and Australia. Rather than reverting to protectionism, it seeks to build on experiences with joint management to date by analysing what lessons South Africa can learn from Australia regarding meeting the conservation, social and financial/economic objectives of its contractual national parks.

Ecotourism initiatives that have been introduced by Porini Ecotourism, a private investor, are benefiting Eselenkei Group Ranch in terms of income, improved infrastructure, employment opportunities and exposure. Over US$5000 is received annually as land rent, gate fee and bed charges. Twenty-six Maasai men are employed for the upkeep of project facilities. The community's capacity to facilitate resource-related conflicts has improved following support from development institutions. An expanding livelihood base is reducing local vulnerability to disaster and people-wildlife conflicts. The numbers of resident wildlife species in the conservation area have increased due to regeneration of woody species and reduced frequency of livestock. <BR>Despite the achievements, ecotourism is threatened by cultivation. The latter is jeopardizing conservation efforts, as the area frequented by wildlife is being lost and people-wildlife conflicts intensified. Another dilemma is that the Eselenkei community is not effectively participating in ecotourism a situation that is associated with inadequate management and negotiation skills in the group ranch committee. The latter requires leadership and microenterprise management skills if earnings from ecotourism are to be effectively invested in alternative sources of livelihood, to reduce current and potential conflicts. There is also need to build the community's capacity for the promotion of activities that compliment ecotourism. Frequent breakdown of community boreholes lead to dependence on the conservation area for water during prolonged drought, intensifying conflicts between livestock and wildlife.","|MA|","|002-014-404|","John Wiley & Sons Ltd<BR>Phone: +44 (0) 1243 843294<BR>E-mail: cs-books@wiley.co.uk",,"|O0340/OPE|",". ogutu z a the impact of ecotourism on livelihood and natural resource management in eselenkei amboseli ecosystem kenya land degradation & development john wiley & sons ltd this paper presents the impact of ecotourism note on livelihood and natural resource management in the periphery of amboseli biosphere reserve in kenya ecotourism initiatives that have been introduced by porini ecotourism a private investor are benefiting eselenkei group ranch in terms of income improved infrastructure employment opportunities and exposure over us$5000 is received annually as land rent gate fee and bed charges twenty six maasai men are employed for the upkeep of project facilities the community s capacity to facilitate resource related conflicts has improved following support from development institutions an expanding livelihood base is reducing local vulnerability to disaster and people wildlife conflicts the numbers of resident wildlife species in the conservation area have increased due to regeneration of woody species and reduced frequency of livestock despite the achievements ecotourism is threatened by cultivation the latter is jeopardizing conservation efforts as the area frequented by wildlife is being lost and people wildlife conflicts intensified another dilemma is that the eselenkei community is not effectively participating in ecotourism a situation that is associated with inadequate management and negotiation skills in the group ranch committee the latter requires leadership and microenterprise management skills if earnings from ecotourism are to be effectively invested in alternative sources of livelihood to reduce current and potential conflicts there is also need to build the community s capacity for the promotion of activities that compliment ecotourism frequent breakdown of community boreholes lead to dependence on the conservation area for water during prolonged drought intensifying conflicts between livestock and wildlife john wiley & sons ltd phone 44 0 1243 843294 e mail cs books wiley co uk o0340 ac .",,

Protected areas of all kinds, e.g., national parks, game reserves, World Heritage sites, and marine parks, are under human pressure from armies, or tourists, migrants, and developers. 5 million sq km have been added to the present total of 6.5 million sq km of protected areas since 1970 and nearly 2 million sq km since 1982. There are almost 8500 sites on the UN list covering an area larger than India. In India, however, only 21 of the 52 national parks have been formally legalized. In the Caribbean only 1/3 of the protected areas are achieving their objectives, and in Norway and New Zealand powerful forces justify the logging of the remnants of ancient forests. Another example is the 15,000 sq km Serengeti World Heritage site in Tanzania and the adjoining Ngoro Ngoro biosphere reserve. The Serengeti is an island in a sea of human settlements with agricultural encroachments, poaching, cattle rustling, and tourism.

But higher economic growth requires greater use of natural resources and environment which in turn leads to their degradation and eventual decay. Increased population pressure on natural resources also contributes to their degradation. Hence, higher growth may not necessarily lead to sustainable development unless it is accompanied by environmental protection. An efficient demand management policy by emphasizing conservation and prudent use of environment can also increase the supply of reserves. One alternative is to attempt to conserve resources via community management of such resources. But community management cannot succeed in absence of appropriate property rights of the community and of women and appropriate institutions to enforce such rights.

Tharus, indigenous to the region, represented 33% of the population; the rest were migrants from the mountains. Tharus had lower literacy rates, larger landholdings and kept different livestock species. Most Tharu families were dependent on extraction from wetlands; all groups used forests for fuelwood but mountain settlers used forests for fodder more than did Tharus. Most respondents expressed willingness to participate in the conservation of Ghodaghodi Lake; however, only 12%, mostly mountain settlers, had ever participated in formal conservation activities. Conservation attitudes were strongly influenced by educational level and resource use. Educated males of higher caste and mountain origin who had previously participated in formal management activities were more positive towards conservation than other groups.

This book presents a balanced perspective on how protected areas relate to poverty, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, protected areas deliver many benefits to the people living around them, ranging from tourism to pollination. On the other hand, protected areas may prevent some forms of resource use, and harbour animals that may damage crops in adjacent lands. But by carefully addressing these potential conflicts in an open and inclusive manner, protected area authorities can forge a productive partnership with the rural poor. The issues certainly will require further discussion, but this book provides a useful beginning that is built on a broad consensus of leading organisations working in conservation and development.","|PA|","|","http://app.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/2004-047.pdf",,"|O0046/CON|",". scherl l m wilson a wild r blockhus j franks p mcneely j a mcshane t o can protected areas contribute to poverty reduction opportunities and limitations iucn gland poverty has become the central concern for development agencies and because many of the areas that are most important for conserving biodiversity are occupied by poor people or have poor people living around them the complex relationship between poverty and protected areas can no longer be ignored this book presents a balanced perspective on how protected areas relate to poverty both positively and negatively on the one hand protected areas deliver many benefits to the people living around them ranging from tourism to pollination on the other hand protected areas may prevent some forms of resource use and harbour animals that may damage crops in adjacent lands but by carefully addressing these potential conflicts in an open and inclusive manner protected area authorities can forge a productive partnership with the rural poor the issues certainly will require further discussion but this book provides a useful beginning that is built on a broad consensus of leading organisations working in conservation and development http app iucn org dbtw wpd edocs 2004 047 pdf o0046 co .",,

Local endowments, conditions affecting the adoption of resource-conserving technologies and local institutions supportive of the poor are key factors that condition poverty–environment interactions and outcomes in relation to agriculture. The main strategies to jointly address poverty and environmental improvement are to increase poor people’s access to natural resources, enhance the productivity of poor people’s natural resource assets and involve local people in resolving public natural resource management concerns.

This observation is consistent with the observations of some development economists who have noted that countries rich in natural resources are often not wealthy countries. Plentiful natural resources per se do not guarantee, nor are they even strongly associated with, regional or country wealth, to say nothing of the distribution of that wealth so as to generate substantial poverty alleviation or freedom from poverty. Clearly the precursors for economic wealth involve a number of factors that are different from the simple abundance of natural resources. Nevertheless, it is important to note that tropical forests, as other types of forest, do provide a host of useful marketed and non-marketed goods and services. These include forest foods and materials, timber, watershed protection and erosion control, recreation, wildlife habitat and biodiversity. An important question is whether these goods and services can, directly or indirectly, readily be harnessed to alleviate poverty.

In India over 50 million people are believed to be directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain ecological cost (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing ‘win-lose’ settings have to be steered to a ‘win-win’ mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods (‘lose-lose’). Examining the dependence of forest fringe communities on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the ecological cost of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined. Within the parameter space of these factors, it is possible to predict outcomes and associations that will conform to win-win or win-lose situations. Empirical data derived from the three study sites demonstrate the causality of the observed associations. The key for long-term livelihood gains lies in reducing the ecological cost.

The South Africa case studies in this report illustrate many examples of best practice and mitigation of biodiversity loss in sectors such as agriculture and forestry. How has this come about? Are the enabling factors and lessons learned peculiar to South Africa, or do the lessons have wider application? Although biodiversity was already being addressed in some sectors during the apartheid period, the change in government and democratization in 1994 clearly led to innovative ways of integrating biodiversity with development needs. The need to do something for the poor made innovations and linkages to socioeconomic benefits imperative.

In many countries, hunting by low-income households also poses a direct threat to many species. This paper reports a study of the wildlife hunting practices of an indigenous cultural community in the Philippine province of Palawan. A survey of hunting practices was conducted among farmers living along the forest margin. The survey collected information on hunting frequency, hunting techniques, and species hunted. These data were combined with household income and demographic data to learn how socioeconomic factors influence hunting patterns and practices. Descriptive statistical procedures and regression analysis show that hunting pressure during the study period was typically greatest among resource-poor households. Poor households used the widest range of hunting implements, including modern implements such as air rifles, and low living standards were associated with greater hunting effort. Households with small farms were more likely to hunt, and were also more likely to expend greater hunting effort. Hunting was a supplementary source of food acquisition for most farmers and was found to be inferior to agricultural production, in the sense that households with large farms tended to hunt less often than households with small farms. Indirect evidence suggests that higher population pressure correlates positively with hunting pressure, and that non-agricultural employment negatively correlates with hunting probability and intensity.","|Ag|","|142-035-608|",,"10.1017/S0376892997000106","|",". shively g e poverty technology and wildlife hunting in palawan environmental conservation cambridge university press cambridge uk tropical forest destruction jeopardizes wildlife habitat in many countries hunting by low income households also poses a direct threat to many species this paper reports a study of the wildlife hunting practices of an indigenous cultural community in the philippine province of palawan a survey of hunting practices was conducted among farmers living along the forest margin the survey collected information on hunting frequency hunting techniques and species hunted these data were combined with household income and demographic data to learn how socioeconomic factors influence hunting patterns and practices descriptive statistical procedures and regression analysis show that hunting pressure during the study period was typically greatest among resource poor households poor households used the widest range of hunting implements including modern implements such as air rifles and low living standards were associated with greater hunting effort households with small farms were more likely to hunt and were also more likely to expend greater hunting effort hunting was a supplementary source of food acquisition for most farmers and was found to be inferior to agricultural production in the sense that households with large farms tended to hunt less often than households with small farms indirect evidence suggests that higher population pressure correlates positively with hunting pressure and that non agricultural employment negatively correlates with hunting probability and intensity doi 10 1017 s0376892997000106 .",,

Calakmul is home to numerous endangered species and raises a common question: How can environmental managers and citizens reconcile competing ecological desires? For a brief time in the 1990s, collaborations at Calakmul were heralded as a vital example of melding local management, forest conservation, and economic development. In Fields of Power, Forests of Discontent, Nora Haenn questions the rise and fall of this conservation program to examine conservation at the intersection of national-international agendas and local political-economic interests. While other assessments of such programs have typically focused on why they do or do not succeed, Haenn instead considers conservation’s encounter with people’s everyday lives—and how those experiences affect environmental management. Haenn explores conservation and development from two perspectives: first regionally, to look at how people used conservation to create a new governing entity on a tropical frontier once weakly under national rule; then locally, focusing on personal histories and aspects of community life that shape people's daily lives, farming practices, and immersion in development programs—even though those programs ultimately fail to resolve economic frustrations. She identifies how key political actors, social movements, and identity politics contributed to the instability of the Calakmul alliance. Drawing on extensive interviews with Reserve staff, including its director, she connects regional trends to village life through accounts of disputes at ejido meetings and the failure of ejido development projects. In the face of continued difficulty in creating a popular conservation in Calakmul, Haenn uses lessons from people's lives—history, livelihood, village organization, expectations—to argue for a \"sustaining conservation,\" one that integrates social justice and local political norms with a new, more robust definition of conservation.

Small wonder this nation is under enormous pressure to sell logging rights to boost short-term economic growth. But converting that value to profit without destroying the forest resource and maintaining the fragile ecosystem is proving to be a difficult and complex task. An open invitation to investors to exploit the forest in any way they see fit will not work. Only maximizing a variety of forest values will improve the livelihoods of people in Guyana. Like many timber-rich, but economically troubled countries -- Cambodia, Laos, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, and Suriname -- Guyana requires stronger government and civil machinery to plan and negotiate foreign investment in logging and to ensure that companies comply with national laws and codes of practice. Guyana's President, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, has made clear commitments to sustainable development by ratifying the Convention on Biological Diversity and by adopting the International Tropical Timber Organization's objective of achieving sustainable production of timber by the year 2000. Also, landmark domestic laws creating the Iwokrama International Rainforest Program and a new Environmental Protection Agency were passed in early 1996. But even with enlightened policies, Guyana still faces serious challenges, including reforming land allocation and land-use planning, reducing damage and increasing revenues from logging, building sustainable communities, developing non-timber forest enterprises, and making foreign assistance more effective. In 1995, President Jagan invited WRI to help him identify options for reforming forest policy in Guyana. This new study, Profit Without Plunder: Reaping Revenue from Guyana's Tropical Forests Without Destroying Them, is WRI's response. The study's author, Dr. Nigel Sizer, explores ways to enhance income from the traditional timber industry and from such alternative forest-based development as tourism, genetic resource harvesting, and non-timber forest products. Based upon this extensive research, Dr. Sizer recommends several priority actions and emphasizes the need for international bilateral and multilateral agencies to better coordinate their efforts. Profit Without Plunder illuminates the complex obstacles to managing forests in ways that are good for the economy, the environment, and society. But it also provides practical alternatives to ill-planned and poorly monitored timber harvesting and puts both the regional debate on forest activities in Latin America and the Caribbean and the international debate on global forestry policies into perspective.","|Fo|","|019-005-328|","Hopkins Fulfillment Service<BR>Phone: +1 410 516-6956<BR>Email: hfscustserv@press.jhu.edu",,"|O0107/EDI|",". sizer n profit without plunder reaping revenue from guyana s tropical forests without destroying them world resources institute guyana s abundant forest resources encompassing 85 percent of its land area at the heart of the guiana shield represent the largest remaining intact tropical forest frontier in the world small wonder this nation is under enormous pressure to sell logging rights to boost short term economic growth but converting that value to profit without destroying the forest resource and maintaining the fragile ecosystem is proving to be a difficult and complex task an open invitation to investors to exploit the forest in any way they see fit will not work only maximizing a variety of forest values will improve the livelihoods of people in guyana like many timber rich but economically troubled countries cambodia laos cameroon congo gabon and suriname guyana requires stronger government and civil machinery to plan and negotiate foreign investment in logging and to ensure that companies comply with national laws and codes of practice guyana s president dr cheddi jagan has made clear commitments to sustainable development by ratifying the convention on biological diversity and by adopting the international tropical timber organization s objective of achieving sustainable production of timber by the year 2000 also landmark domestic laws creating the iwokrama international rainforest program and a new environmental protection agency were passed in early 1996 but even with enlightened policies guyana still faces serious challenges including reforming land allocation and land use planning reducing damage and increasing revenues from logging building sustainable communities developing non timber forest enterprises and making foreign assistance more effective in 1995 president jagan invited wri to help him identify options for reforming forest policy in guyana this new study profit without plunder reaping revenue from guyana s tropical forests without destroying them is wri s response the study s author dr nigel sizer explores ways to enhance income from the traditional timber industry and from such alternative forest based development as tourism genetic resource harvesting and non timber forest products based upon this extensive research dr sizer recommends several priority actions and emphasizes the need for international bilateral and multilateral agencies to better coordinate their efforts profit without plunder illuminates the complex obstacles to managing forests in ways that are good for the economy the environment and society but it also provides practical alternatives to ill planned and poorly monitored timber harvesting and puts both the regional debate on forest activities in latin america and the caribbean and the international debate on global forestry policies into perspective hopkins fulfillment service phone 1 410 516 6956 email hfscustserv press jhu edu o0107 ed .",,

The underlying assumption was that the local communities residing in the Reserve may not have been involved, or consulted in the process of formulating the policy and legislation. Results overwhelmingly confirmed this hypothesis – as 65% of the community members interviewed were unaware of the approved Forest and Wildlife Policy, and associated Legislation. 74% had never even heard of the new Land Law, 88% indicated they were not involved in any management of natural resources in the Reserve, and the majority, 53% had never even heard of any community-based natural resource management programme. The widespread unawareness of the various enabling mechanisms established by the Mozambican Government to ensure that rural people actively participate in, and sustainably and tangibly benefit from the management of natural resources is of great concern. More particularly so, as the frameworks, and strategies for achieving this have been developed under the Transfrontier Conservation Areas Project (TFCA). This study recommends, inter alia: (i) that the Directorate for Forestry and Wildlife establishes a Community Education and Public Relations Unit (CEPRU) in the Maputo TFCA in order to improve community awareness of the opportunities, and various enabling policies and legislation, especially with respect to communities' rights vis-à-vis ownership of land and the associated natural resources; (ii) the introduction of community-based tourism as a means of diversifying communities' income base. Currently nearly 82% of community members in the Reserve depend on consumptive use of wildlife, and as the human population grows the pressure may overwhelm the resource base. Generation of revenues through community-based tourism may be an incentive for communities to adopt biodiversity conservation based market economy as an alternative to their subsistence livelihood styles.","|PA|IR|","|002-014-508|","http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/bioc/2001/00000010/00000010/00322384",,"|O0019/COG|",". soto b munthali s m breen c perceptions of the forestry and wildlife policy by the local communities living in the maputo elephant reserve mozambique biodiversity and conservation kluwer academic publishers a survey was undertaken in the maputo elephant reserve to establish the level of people s dependence on wildlife and their perceptions of the extant forest and wildlife policy and the associated legislation including the new land law the underlying assumption was that the local communities residing in the reserve may not have been involved or consulted in the process of formulating the policy and legislation results overwhelmingly confirmed this hypothesis – as 65% of the community members interviewed were unaware of the approved forest and wildlife policy and associated legislation 74% had never even heard of the new land law 88% indicated they were not involved in any management of natural resources in the reserve and the majority 53% had never even heard of any community based natural resource management programme the widespread unawareness of the various enabling mechanisms established by the mozambican government to ensure that rural people actively participate in and sustainably and tangibly benefit from the management of natural resources is of great concern more particularly so as the frameworks and strategies for achieving this have been developed under the transfrontier conservation areas project tfca this study recommends inter alia i that the directorate for forestry and wildlife establishes a community education and public relations unit cepru in the maputo tfca in order to improve community awareness of the opportunities and various enabling policies and legislation especially with respect to communities rights vis à vis ownership of land and the associated natural resources; ii the introduction of community based tourism as a means of diversifying communities income base currently nearly 82% of community members in the reserve depend on consumptive use of wildlife and as the human population grows the pressure may overwhelm the resource base generation of revenues through community based tourism may be an incentive for communities to adopt biodiversity conservation based market economy as an alternative to their subsistence livelihood styles http www ingentaconnect com content klu bioc 2001 00000010 00000010 00322384 o0019 go .",,

Confronted with severe poverty arising from small landholdings and scarce nonfarming employment opportunities, villagers in the upper portion of the watershed have benefited considerably from the income derived from NTFPs. Findings indicate that various components of a common forest resource can be managed differently and undergo degradation at different rates. NTFPs are undergoing degradation more seriously than timber under both government and community forest management systems. However, NTFP degradation is more serious in government forests than in community forests.

Data were obtained from questionnaires, published and unpublished accounts, and direct observations. Despite numerous problems, all protected areas conserved indigenous rain forest biodiversity more effectively than did alternative land uses. More than half the protected areas suffered extensive ecological isolation. Effective management of protected areas was seriously compromised by inadequate funding and government support. Dense human populations, often resulting from immigration, constituted major threats to protected areas. Perceived conservation success was greatest for large protected areas surrounded by similar habitat with strong public support, effective law enforcement, low human population densities, and substantial support from international donors. Contrary to expectations, protected area success was not directly correlated with employment benefits for the neighboring community, conservation education, conservation clubs, or with the presence and extent of integrated conservation and development programs. Studies are needed to better understand what shapes positive pubic attitude towards protected areas because none of the conventional public outreach programs were correlated with public attitude. We also identify apparent deficiencies in foreign assistance to these protected areas. The single most important short-term strategy was considered to be the improvement of law enforcement effectiveness through greater technical and financial support. Nine medium-term strategies are identified, including provision of adequate and secure long-term funding, establishing research and monitoring programs, and developing more appropriate conservation and development programs. Long-term strategies deal with two ultimate causal factors, mainly attitudes and value systems, and stabilizing human populations.

What could be done differently? In Requiem for Nature, he offers brutally honest answers to those difficult questions, and appraises the prospects for the future of tropical conservation. Terborgh examines current conservation strategies and considers the shortcomings of parks and protected areas both from ecological and institutional perspectives.

Central to policy making in India is the enduring concern with the large number of poor agricultural households and their income vulnerablity. These concerns, in turn, drive both policy and public expenditure in agriculture. While significant progress has been made towards rapid agricultural growth, eradication of poverty, and ensuring food security, since the 1990s agricultural growth has slowed down. A concern with the slowdown is evident in the priority given to raising agricultural productivity in the Indian government's National Agricultural Policy and the 10th Five Year Plan.<BR>In comprehensively addressing these issues, the report recommends:<BR>- Moving away from traditional subsidy-based regimes <BR>- Building a highly productive, internationally competitive agricultural sector <BR>- Making t he sector more diversified<BR>- Such a programme, the report argues, will have a direct impact on reducing poverty by:<BR>- Enhancing producer incomes <BR>- Maximizing consumer welfare through changes in food prices <BR>- Increasing employment and wage effects leading to growth-induced effects throughout the economy.<BR>Providing important data on the state and future directions of India's agricultural sector, that is compatible and sustainable with the changed environment of the twenty-first century, the report suggests concrete policy options for increased productivity.

Throughout history, virtually all civilizations have spent considerable time defining land rights and establishing institutions to administer them. Well-defined, secure, and transferable rights to land are crucial to development efforts. In developing countries, most land is used for agricultural production, a mainstay of economic sustenance. The possession of land rights also typically ensures a baseline of shelter and food supply and allows people to turn latent assets into live capital through entrepreneurial activity. Once secure in their land rights, rural households invest to increase productivity. Moreover, the use of land as a primary investment vehicle allows households to accumulate and transfer wealth between generations. The ability to use land rights as collateral for credit helps create a stronger investment climate and land rights are thus, at the level of the economy, a pre-condition for the emergence and operation of financial markets. Property rights to land are one of the cornerstones for the functioning of modern economies. This book looks first at the historical, conceptual, and legal contexts of property rights to land. It then considers aspects of land transactions, including the key factors affecting the functioning of rural land markets. Finally, it explores the scope and role of governments and land policy formation and discusses ways in which developing countries can establish land policy frameworks that maximize social benefit.","|GP|","|","The World Bank Bookshop<BR>Telephone: +1 202 458-4500<BR>Email: pic@worldbank.org",,"|O0145/DOU|",". world bank land policies for growth and poverty reduction une politique fonciere pour la croissance et la lutte contre la pauvrete oxford university press usa land is a key component of the wealth of any nation throughout history virtually all civilizations have spent considerable time defining land rights and establishing institutions to administer them well defined secure and transferable rights to land are crucial to development efforts in developing countries most land is used for agricultural production a mainstay of economic sustenance the possession of land rights also typically ensures a baseline of shelter and food supply and allows people to turn latent assets into live capital through entrepreneurial activity once secure in their land rights rural households invest to increase productivity moreover the use of land as a primary investment vehicle allows households to accumulate and transfer wealth between generations the ability to use land rights as collateral for credit helps create a stronger investment climate and land rights are thus at the level of the economy a pre condition for the emergence and operation of financial markets property rights to land are one of the cornerstones for the functioning of modern economies this book looks first at the historical conceptual and legal contexts of property rights to land it then considers aspects of land transactions including the key factors affecting the functioning of rural land markets finally it explores the scope and role of governments and land policy formation and discusses ways in which developing countries can establish land policy frameworks that maximize social benefit the world bank bookshop telephone 1 202 458 4500 email pic worldbank org o0145 da .",,

Illegal logging and forest degradation are currently increasing, and logging bans are ineffective in reducing forest degradation. At the same time interest in forest plantations and concern about poverty problems of people adjacent to forests continue to increase rapidly. Governments have identified the development of small forest plantations as an opportunity to provide wood supplies to forest industries and to reduce poverty. However, the development of small plantations is very slow due to an imbalance of power and suspicion between communities and large companies. Current regulations do not offer many links amongst various stakeholders. The paper proposes a framework to link up social, economic and biophysical dynamics using multiagent simulation to explore scenarios of collaboration for plantations. Multiagent simulation is a branch of artificial intelligence that offers a promising approach to deal with multi stakeholder management systems, such as the case involving common pool of resources. It provides a framework, which allows analysis of stakeholders’ (or agents’) decisions in interaction. Each stakeholder has explicit communication capacities, behaviors and rational from which emerge specific actions. The purpose of this modeling is to create a common dynamic representation to facilitate negotiations to grow trees. Collaborations involving multistakeholders, especially local communities and wood based industries, appeared to offer the most promising pathway to accelerate plantation development toward local communities’ poverty alleviation and forest landscape improvement.","|Fo|","|","CIFOR <BR>Email: CIFOR-Library@cgiar.org",,"|O0014/EDI|",". purnomo h guizol p governing forest plantation to reduce poverty and improve forest landscape a multiagent simulation approach modsim 2003 international congress on modelling and simulation integrative modelling of biophysical social and economic systems for resource management solutions 14 17 july 2003 townsville australia post d a modelling and simulation society of australia and new zealand canberra australia good forest governance lets all relevant stakeholders participate in the decision making processes illegal logging and forest degradation are currently increasing and logging bans are ineffective in reducing forest degradation at the same time interest in forest plantations and concern about poverty problems of people adjacent to forests continue to increase rapidly governments have identified the development of small forest plantations as an opportunity to provide wood supplies to forest industries and to reduce poverty however the development of small plantations is very slow due to an imbalance of power and suspicion between communities and large companies current regulations do not offer many links amongst various stakeholders the paper proposes a framework to link up social economic and biophysical dynamics using multiagent simulation to explore scenarios of collaboration for plantations multiagent simulation is a branch of artificial intelligence that offers a promising approach to deal with multi stakeholder management systems such as the case involving common pool of resources it provides a framework which allows analysis of stakeholders’ or agents’ decisions in interaction each stakeholder has explicit communication capacities behaviors and rational from which emerge specific actions the purpose of this modeling is to create a common dynamic representation to facilitate negotiations to grow trees collaborations involving multistakeholders especially local communities and wood based industries appeared to offer the most promising pathway to accelerate plantation development toward local communities’ poverty alleviation and forest landscape improvement cifor email cifor library cgiar org o0014 ed .",,

This erosion has caused economic losses, jeopardizing productivity and food security, and leading to broader social costs. Equally alarming is the loss of biodiversity in \"natural\" habitats from the expansion of agricultural production to frontier areas. The conflicts between agriculture and biodiversity are by no means inevitable. With sustainable farming practices and changes in agricultural policies and institutions, they can be overcome.

Prior to the 1970s, global conservation objectives were pursued primarily through the establishment of a system of nationally protected areas; however, this strategy did not dedicate significant consideration to the effects of designating these areas on the communities that live in and near the protected areas and depend on them for their livelihoods. After the 1970s, a shift occurred in the conservation community with the emergence of “community-based conservation” efforts that combined the achievement of human livelihood goals and conservation goals and that became perceived as the solution to conservation concerns.  It is in this context that the Equator Initiative has emerged to identify local partnerships for sustainable development that achieve poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation in tropical countries. This paper seeks to contribute to the Equator Initiative’s research and learning objectives by examining the debate surrounding community-based conservation. The paper then proposes that leadership should be analyzed as a factor that contributes to the effectiveness of community-based conservation initiatives. Five characteristics of leadership are identified as being critical to success: innovation, communication, learning, bridge-building and systems thinking. The paper concludes with recommendations to the Equator Initiative on how to facilitate leadership for local partnership.","|CC|","|","http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidwp/pdf/grad_student/002.pdf",,"|O0203/OPE|",". timmer v community based conservation and leadership frameworks for analyzing the equator initiative cid graduate student and postdoctoral fellow working paper center for international development at harvard university boston reconciling human development requirements with the need to sustain healthy ecosystems is a challenge that has spurred debate across scales from local community management organizations to global decision making bodies prior to the 1970s global conservation objectives were pursued primarily through the establishment of a system of nationally protected areas; however this strategy did not dedicate significant consideration to the effects of designating these areas on the communities that live in and near the protected areas and depend on them for their livelihoods after the 1970s a shift occurred in the conservation community with the emergence of “community based conservation” efforts that combined the achievement of human livelihood goals and conservation goals and that became perceived as the solution to conservation concerns it is in this context that the equator initiative has emerged to identify local partnerships for sustainable development that achieve poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation in tropical countries this paper seeks to contribute to the equator initiative’s research and learning objectives by examining the debate surrounding community based conservation the paper then proposes that leadership should be analyzed as a factor that contributes to the effectiveness of community based conservation initiatives five characteristics of leadership are identified as being critical to success innovation communication learning bridge building and systems thinking the paper concludes with recommendations to the equator initiative on how to facilitate leadership for local partnership http www cid harvard edu cidwp pdf grad_student 002 pdf o0203 ac .",,

Some of the actors directly responsible for forest conversion fell trees to meet food security needs and alleviate poverty—issues of urgent interest to them and also to national policymakers. This multiplicity of groups with differing (often conflicting) interests in the multifarious goods and services produced by tropical forests complicates the search for alternative agricultural activities for forest margins since these alternatives must satisfy such divergent objectives. This paper sets out a conceptual framework for comparing the impacts of different land use systems and agricultural practices at the margins of tropical rainforests in terms of the concerns and objectives of two key interest groups: small-scale farmers seeking livelihoods at the forest margins and the ‘international' interests in the global public goods and services supplied by tropical rainforests. This framework should be useful to a third key group, the national and regional policymakers who must consider these and other policy objectives and then decide on courses of action. The paper identifies data needs and analytical methods capable of supplying an empirical base for this conceptual framework, based on quantifiable indicators. It then presents preliminary results of the application of this conceptual framework in Indonesia and Brazil in association with a global, collaborative, multidisciplinary research program. Even using preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates (to be replaced by more precise measurements as they become available), this conceptual framework presents results in ways that allow researchers and policymakers to select clear ‘best bets' for development, when they exist, and to assess tradeoffs and options for complementary policy action and research efforts, when they do not.","|Ag|Fo|","|019-005-076|142-035-360|",,"10.1016/S0169-5150(98)00032-2","|O0035/EDI|O0039/EDI|",".  tomich t p van noordwijk m vosti s a witcover j agricultural development with rainforest conservation methods for seeking best bet alternatives to slash and burn with applications to brazil and indonesia agricultural economics elsevier science ltd uk forests continue to fall for agricultural purposes throughout the humid tropics with immediate and potentially large consequences for climate change and biodiversity loss—issues of key interest to the international community some of the actors directly responsible for forest conversion fell trees to meet food security needs and alleviate poverty—issues of urgent interest to them and also to national policymakers this multiplicity of groups with differing often conflicting interests in the multifarious goods and services produced by tropical forests complicates the search for alternative agricultural activities for forest margins since these alternatives must satisfy such divergent objectives this paper sets out a conceptual framework for comparing the impacts of different land use systems and agricultural practices at the margins of tropical rainforests in terms of the concerns and objectives of two key interest groups small scale farmers seeking livelihoods at the forest margins and the ‘international interests in the global public goods and services supplied by tropical rainforests this framework should be useful to a third key group the national and regional policymakers who must consider these and other policy objectives and then decide on courses of action the paper identifies data needs and analytical methods capable of supplying an empirical base for this conceptual framework based on quantifiable indicators it then presents preliminary results of the application of this conceptual framework in indonesia and brazil in association with a global collaborative multidisciplinary research program even using preliminary order of magnitude estimates to be replaced by more precise measurements as they become available this conceptual framework presents results in ways that allow researchers and policymakers to select clear ‘best bets for development when they exist and to assess tradeoffs and options for complementary policy action and research efforts when they do not o0035 edi o0039 edi  .",,

Co-management is a pluralist approach to managing natural resources, incorporating a variety of partners in a variety of roles, generally to the end goals of environmental conservation, sustainable use of natural resources and the equitable sharing of resource-related benefits and responsibilities. This paper assumes that rural poverty could be reduced in Nigeria through co-management of natural resources on which most rural poor depend for livelihood. The paper first reviews the causes, distribution and level of poverty in Nigeria and explains why government programs have not succeeded in reducing poverty in the country particularly in the rural areas. The paper also discusses the vicious cycle that exists between poverty, natural resource degradation and conflicts as a way of justifying why appropriate management of natural resources could prevent destructive conflicts and consequently, reduce rural poverty. The paper then suggests 1) mechanisms for involving all major stakeholders in establishing co-management institutions, 2) roles the stakeholders should play, 3) ways for strengthening and sustaining the co-management institutions if established, and 4) the need for incorporating participatory monitoring and evaluation in the co-management institutions.

Wealth of the Poor - Managing Ecosystems to Fight Poverty","Bk",,,,,,"200 pp.","World Resources Institute, Washington, D.C.","Ecosystems are - or can be - the wealth of the poor. For many of the 1.1 billion people living in severe poverty, nature has always been a daily lifeline - an asset for those with few other material assets. But programs to reduce poverty often fail to account for the important link between environment and the livelihoods of the poor. World Resources 2005 argues that the generative power of nature - the bounty of ecosystems - can act as a fundamental stepping stone in the economic integration of the poor. This requires, first, that the poor manage ecosystems so that they attain - or regain - stable productivity over time. But it also requires that the poor are able to reap the benefits of this good stewardship. Unfortunately, those poverty are rarely in such a position of power over natural resources. An array of governance failures typical intervenes: lack of legal ownership and access to ecosystems, political marginalization, and exclusion from those decisions that affect how these ecosystems are managed. Without addressing these failures, there is little chance of using the economic potential of ecosystems for reducing poverty. World Resources 2005 details the steps necessary to empower the poor to use ecosystems both wisely and for wealth. Using examples and case studies, the report traces a route to greater environmental income. Working at the cutting edge of sustainable development, it lays out the governance changes necessary to give the poor the legal, financial and management capacity to use nature for wealth creation that does not deplete their fragile resource base.

Nevertheless, it requires an appropriate developmental paradigm that can provide a more relevant perceptual and interpretive framework from which such strategies may emerge. The prevailing dominant social paradigm has ignored the following problems: the present level of resource consumption in the developed industrialized countries, the acute poverty and inequitable development pattern in the Third World, the massive capital flight from 'global' South to 'global' North, and the massive population growth-rates in poor Third World countries, for political or ideological reasons. This paradigm will ultimately lead to environmental destruction and collapse of The Biosphere if 'business' continues 'as usual'. There has been unwillingness on the part of the politicians to admit this truth, but the development philosophy that does not include the strategies which can induce changes in our consumption and behavioural patterns, attitudes towards Nature, environmentally sound conservation and management practices and principles, elimination of poverty and inequity, and reduction of global population growth, will achieve nothing more than, as Morowitz (1991) calls it, a 'Sisyphus's Myth'. Only a development paradigm that is deeply rooted in the principle of cooperation, social synergism, equity, and the understanding of ecological and social sustainability of resource uses, allocation, and management, can offer hope and engender optimism.

Transfrontier conservation areas, or ‘Peace Parks’ as they are popularly called, have been identified as key instruments to promote the African Renaissance dream, and are increasingly advocated and justified on this basis. By fostering joint conservation (and tourism) development in Southern Africa's marginalised border regions, Peace Parks are claimed to further international peace, regional cooperation and poverty reduction, and thus serve basic ideals of the African Renaissance. This article critically explores this assumption. Using the joint South African-Mozambican-Zimbabwean Great Limpopo Park as a case study, it argues that in reality the creation of Peace Parks hardly stimulates and possibly even undermines the realisation of the African Renaissance ideals of regional cooperation, emancipation, cultural reaffirmation, sustainable economic development and democratisation. So far, their achievement has been severely hindered by domination of national interests, insufficient community consultation, and sensitive border issues such as the illegal flows of goods and migrants between South Africa and neighbouring countries. Furthermore, exacerbation of inter-state differences induced by power imbalances in the region, and harmonisation of land use and legal systems across boundaries, are increasingly becoming sources of conflict and controversy. Some of these problems are so severe, we conclude, that they might eventually even undermine support for African Renaissance as a whole. Utmost care is thus required to optimally use the chances that Peace Parks do offer in furthering an African Renaissance.","|PA|","|002-018-710|","Cambridge University Press<BR>Phone: +44 (0)1223 326070<BR>Email: journals@cambridge.org",,"|O0266/OPE|O0300/OPE|",". van amerom m büscher b peace parks in southern africa bringers of an african renaissance the journal of modern african studies cambridge university press cambridge uk the pursuit of an african renaissance has become an important aspect of regional cooperation between south africa and its neighbours transfrontier conservation areas or ‘peace parks’ as they are popularly called have been identified as key instruments to promote the african renaissance dream and are increasingly advocated and justified on this basis by fostering joint conservation and tourism development in southern africa s marginalised border regions peace parks are claimed to further international peace regional cooperation and poverty reduction and thus serve basic ideals of the african renaissance this article critically explores this assumption using the joint south african mozambican zimbabwean great limpopo park as a case study it argues that in reality the creation of peace parks hardly stimulates and possibly even undermines the realisation of the african renaissance ideals of regional cooperation emancipation cultural reaffirmation sustainable economic development and democratisation so far their achievement has been severely hindered by domination of national interests insufficient community consultation and sensitive border issues such as the illegal flows of goods and migrants between south africa and neighbouring countries furthermore exacerbation of inter state differences induced by power imbalances in the region and harmonisation of land use and legal systems across boundaries are increasingly becoming sources of conflict and controversy some of these problems are so severe we conclude that they might eventually even undermine support for african renaissance as a whole utmost care is thus required to optimally use the chances that peace parks do offer in furthering an african renaissance cambridge university press phone 44 0 1223 326070 email journals cambridge org o0266 ac o0300 ac .",,

Nevertheless, it remains under severe threat of deforestation. Rainforest destruction has already caused a decline in ecological functions and services. Besides, it is affecting numerous economic activities in and around the Leuser National Park. The objectives of this study are twofold: firstly, to determine the total economic value (TEV) of the Leuser Ecosystem through a systems dynamic model. And secondly, to evaluate the economic consequences of deforestation versus conservation, disaggregating the economic value for the main stakeholders and regions involved. Using a dynamic simulation model, economic valuation is applied to evaluate the TEV of the Leuser National Park over the period 2000–2030. Three scenarios are considered: ‘conservation’, ‘deforestation’ and, ‘selective use’. The results are presented in terms of (1) the type of benefits, (2) the allocation of these benefits among stakeholders, and (3) the regional distribution of benefits. The economic benefits considered include: water supply, fisheries, flood and drought prevention, agriculture and plantations, hydro-electricity, tourism, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, fire prevention, non-timber forest products, and timber. The stakeholders include: local community members, the local government, the logging and plantation industry, the national government, and the international community. The regions considered cover the 11 districts involved in the management of the Leuser Ecosystem. With a 4% discount rate, the accumulated TEV for the ecosystem over the 30-year period is: US $7.0 billion under the ‘deforestation scenario’, US $9.5 billion under the ‘conservation scenario’ and US $9.1 billion under the ‘selective utilisation scenario’. The main contributors in the conservation and selective use scenarios are water supply, flood prevention, tourism and agriculture. Timber revenues play an important role in the deforestation scenario. Compared to deforestation, conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem benefits all categories of stakeholders, except for the elite logging and plantation industry.","|MA|","|142-035-360|",,"10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00224-0","|",". van beukering p j h cesar h s j janssen m a economic valuation of the leuser national park on sumatra indonesia ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk the leuser ecosystem in northern sumatra is officially protected by its status as an indonesian national park nevertheless it remains under severe threat of deforestation rainforest destruction has already caused a decline in ecological functions and services besides it is affecting numerous economic activities in and around the leuser national park the objectives of this study are twofold firstly to determine the total economic value tev of the leuser ecosystem through a systems dynamic model and secondly to evaluate the economic consequences of deforestation versus conservation disaggregating the economic value for the main stakeholders and regions involved using a dynamic simulation model economic valuation is applied to evaluate the tev of the leuser national park over the period 2000–2030 three scenarios are considered ‘conservation’ ‘deforestation’ and ‘selective use’ the results are presented in terms of 1 the type of benefits 2 the allocation of these benefits among stakeholders and 3 the regional distribution of benefits the economic benefits considered include water supply fisheries flood and drought prevention agriculture and plantations hydro electricity tourism biodiversity carbon sequestration fire prevention non timber forest products and timber the stakeholders include local community members the local government the logging and plantation industry the national government and the international community the regions considered cover the 11 districts involved in the management of the leuser ecosystem with a 4% discount rate the accumulated tev for the ecosystem over the 30 year period is us $7 0 billion under the ‘deforestation scenario’ us $9 5 billion under the ‘conservation scenario’ and us $9 1 billion under the ‘selective utilisation scenario’ the main contributors in the conservation and selective use scenarios are water supply flood prevention tourism and agriculture timber revenues play an important role in the deforestation scenario compared to deforestation conservation of the leuser ecosystem benefits all categories of stakeholders except for the elite logging and plantation industry doi 10 1016 s0921 8009 02 00224 0 .",,

"649","B0937","Vandergeest, P.|","199600","Property Rights in Protected Areas: Obstacles to Community Involvement as a Solution in Thailand","JA","Environmental Conservation",,"23","3","Vol 23 No 3","pp. 259-268","Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK","Conflicts between local people and managers of protected areas (PAs) have often undermined conservation goals in Asia. Since the 1970s, conservation planners have tried to address these problems by incorporating rural development into PA planning. More recently, many conservationists have argued for increasing community involvement in PA management, and for allowing traditional resource uses inside PAs. Based on research in Thailand I make three arguments regarding obstacles to implementing the new approach. In Thailand, laws governing Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks enacted in the early 1960s were premised on the idea that human use and nature preservation were incompatible. Rapid expansion of these PAs in recent years has produced endemic conflict with rural people claiming resources inside PAs. To address this problem, the Thai Royal Forestry Department has cooperated with NGOs providing development assistance to rural people living in buffer zones outside of some PAs. I argue that this approach has met limited success because the main source of conflict is not poverty but claims on resources inside PAs. The second argument is that the Forestry Department has resisted changes to laws making local use inside PAs illegal because these laws are important for consolidating the Department's control over territory and in justifying increasing budgetary allocations. In addition, by redefining itself as an organization devoted to strict defence of forests, the Department has obtained the support of many urban environmentalists. The third argument is that the community forest approach taken by a recent draft Community Forest Bill is an important first step in that it implicitly recognizes community property. At the same time, this approach will also fail to address key problems because it is based on a notion of the traditional village, and does not allow for the commercial nature of rural forest use or the household-based nature of forest tenure. I suggest that the new expansion of PAs be halted, that land claimed by rural households be taken out of PAs, and that the government recognize community management rights in areas that remain classified as protected. More generally, the goals of conservation would be better achieved by replacing an approach based on the rapid expansion of PAs with one promoting conservation outside PAs.","|PA|","|142-035-764|",,,"|",".  vandergeest p property rights in protected areas obstacles to community involvement as a solution in thailand environmental conservation cambridge university press cambridge uk conflicts between local people and managers of protected areas pas have often undermined conservation goals in asia since the 1970s conservation planners have tried to address these problems by incorporating rural development into pa planning more recently many conservationists have argued for increasing community involvement in pa management and for allowing traditional resource uses inside pas based on research in thailand i make three arguments regarding obstacles to implementing the new approach in thailand laws governing wildlife sanctuaries and national parks enacted in the early 1960s were premised on the idea that human use and nature preservation were incompatible rapid expansion of these pas in recent years has produced endemic conflict with rural people claiming resources inside pas to address this problem the thai royal forestry department has cooperated with ngos providing development assistance to rural people living in buffer zones outside of some pas i argue that this approach has met limited success because the main source of conflict is not poverty but claims on resources inside pas the second argument is that the forestry department has resisted changes to laws making local use inside pas illegal because these laws are important for consolidating the department s control over territory and in justifying increasing budgetary allocations in addition by redefining itself as an organization devoted to strict defence of forests the department has obtained the support of many urban environmentalists the third argument is that the community forest approach taken by a recent draft community forest bill is an important first step in that it implicitly recognizes community property at the same time this approach will also fail to address key problems because it is based on a notion of the traditional village and does not allow for the commercial nature of rural forest use or the household based nature of forest tenure i suggest that the new expansion of pas be halted that land claimed by rural households be taken out of pas and that the government recognize community management rights in areas that remain classified as protected more generally the goals of conservation would be better achieved by replacing an approach based on the rapid expansion of pas with one promoting conservation outside pas  .",,

This article summarizes empirical evidence regarding the implementation of CNRM, based on five case studies in Nepal, the U.S. states of Alaska and Washington, and Kenya. Six social and environmental indicators are used to evaluate and compare these cases, including equity, empowerment, conflict resolution, knowledge and awareness, biodiversity protection, and sustainable resource utilization. The results of this analysis indicate that, despite sincere attempts and some success, serious deficiencies are widely evident. In especially Nepal and Kenya, CNRM rarely resulted in more equitable distribution of power and economic benefits, reduced conflict, increased consideration of traditional or modern environmental knowledge, protection of biological diversity, or sustainable resource use. By contrast, CNRM in the North American cases was more successful.

This study identifies the causes of conflicts between local people and the Bénoué Wildlife Conservation Area (BWCA), which includes the Bénoué National Park, in northern Cameroon. Informal interviews and questionnaires were administered to 114 households in three communities, and to 17 Park staff and seven professional hunting guides. Crop damage affected 86% of the surveyed households, with 31% of crop income lost on average, and with the damage varying significantly between communities. Elephants, baboons, patas monkeys, warthogs and green parrots accounted for 97% of crop damage, with the staple foods maize and millet being most affected. Of the respondents, 28% experienced livestock depredation, with 18% of livestock income lost on average. The civet cat was the main predator. The involvement of local people in illegal activities, their lack of access to natural resources, and damage by wildlife were identified as principal causes of conflicts. Local people, park staff and professional hunting guides had diverse and differing perceptions about the causes of the conflicts, and made various suggestions for reduction of wildlife damage including animal scaring and controlled shooting.

Protected area benefits and costs are discussed at three separate spatial scales: local, national/regional, and global/transnational. The overall picture shows that economic benefits--although difficult to measure and varying from site to site--are limited on a local scale, increase somewhat on a regional/national level and then become potentially substantial on a transnational/global scale. The economic costs follow an opposite trend, from being locally significant, regionally and nationally moderate, and globally small.

In response to this challenge, a new set of initiatives has been launched in an attempt to reconcile the management of protected areas with the social and economic needs of local people. Jointly labelled integrated conservation-development projects (ICDPs), these efforts include biosphere reserves, multiple-use areas, buffer zone management plans, large-scale development projects with links to protected areas.

Nature tourism is particularly important in the context of sustainable development because it offers the potential of mobilizing resources through the private sector which can contribute to local and national economic development while providing an incentive for conservation land uses and helping to finance biodiversity conservation. But analysts have argued that there is a significant gap between nature tourism ' s actual and potential contribution to sustainable development. From a conservation perspective, most governments have not invested sufficient attention or resources in managing the natural assets. Unregulated tourism development has exposed sensitive sites of ecological or cultural value to the risk of degradation. The overall growth potential and some promising individual cases do suggest that nature tourism is an important sector where environmental conservation may effectively be combined with economic development in remote rural areas of developing countries on a meaningful scale.

Chapter one provides an outline of the global and regional distribution of coral reefs and the different types of people who depend upon reefs, focusing on poor reef stakeholders and areas where poverty and reefs coincide. Chapter two is the main section of the report and provides an overview of the different reef-related benefit flows to the poor. This chapter is based on an analysis of benefit flows using the sustainable livelihoods framework and includes much of the RLA case study results. Its focus is on the positive benefits which the reef provides to all aspects of the livelihoods of the poor. It does not consider the cost of those benefits on the status of the reef resource; this aspect is dealt with, in terms of how that cost impacts on the lives of the poor, in the following chapter. Chapter three reviews the changes that are occurring in the benefit flows to the poor from the reef and briefly considers why these are occurring. Again, these changes are considered in terms of their impacts on the lives of the poor and how the poor have responded to change, for this reason the ecological aspects and consequences of change are not considered in any detail. Chapter four briefly reviews some of the different reef-related interventions that now affect the lives of reef-dependent poor and briefly assesses their impact on the poor. Once again, the poverty and people focus shifts the attention away from the reef resource and considers interventions in terms of how they have benefited poor reef stakeholders. This provides a different perspective from that normally encountered, which primarily considers interventions in terms of how they have benefited the health of the reef resource. This is not to discredit or diminish the good intentions of many interventions focused on the reef resource and its conservation, but it is to take a different view point. Chapter five discusses the findings from the previous four chapters and evolves some principles for addressing poverty-related reef issues. It also looks at the policy implications of the findings and suggests some ways forward.

The Neo-Malthusian approach sees population pressure as the underlying cause of tropical deforestation. The government-failure approach looks at misdirected policies that result in unintended deforestation and government's inability to preclude preventable deforestation. The microeconomic approach examines how, under various forms of market failure, an agent's economic behaviours can lead to deforestation. The macroeconomic approach explores the possible links between debt and deforestation.

Moreover, the recurring costs of managing protected areas and the opportunity costs of forgoing logging and farming to maintain protected areas are a substantial net drain on national and local economies. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly important that protected areas generate, from user fees or donor contributions, sufficient funds to offset the costs of maintaining them. Government and donor investment currently meet less than 30 per cent of the estimated recurring costs required to manage the protected-area network within Central African countries effectively, and cover none of the growing opportunity costs. Nature tourism, the fastest growing sector of the $US3 trillion (3 million million) a year global tourism industry, may offer a source of revenue to help fill this gap in funds. Congo Basin national parks and reserves harbour many charismatic animals (okapi, lowland gorilla, mandrills, bongo, forest elephant) that are likely to attract tourists, and as a result many protected-area managers are sinking capital into the development of tourist infrastructure.

The ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1993 represents an international consensus to conserve biodiversity including that of farm animal genetic resources (FAnGR). In Africa, conservation of agricultural biodiversity is inbuilt into the low input-low output production strategies of smallholder farming systems. These systems are often associated with poverty in rural areas and numerous development projects have thus sought to alleviate such poverty by promoting crossbreeding or modern reproductive technologies. However, uncontrolled crossbreeding has been and remains a threat to the conservation of local farm animal populations. Objectives for the conservation of a local farm animal population and opportunities to utilise its diversity to meet present and future market demands, to serve as an insurance against environmental changes such as changes in production, socio-economic, and cultural conditions can be identified for research and development. To improve food security and to alleviate poverty through the conservation of FAnGR in Africa, utilisation of local farm animal populations depends on the ability of communities to decide on and implement appropriate breeding strategies.

Microimpacts of rising poverty can increase or slow forest loss. At the macrolevel, poverty also has an ambiguous effect, but it is probable that higher income stimulates forest loss by raising demand for agricultural land. The second question is what potential forest-led development has to alleviate a country's poverty, in terms of producer benefits, consumer benefits and economy-wide employment. Natural forests widely serve as ''safety nets'' for the rural poor, but it proves difficult to raise producer benefits significantly. Urban consumer benefits from forest, an important target for pro-poor agricultural innovation, are limited and seldom favor the poor. Absorption of (poor) unskilled labor is low in forestry, which tends to be capital-intensive. Natural forests may thus lack comparative advantage for poverty alleviation. There are few ''win-win'' synergies between natural forests and national poverty reduction, which may help to explain why the loss of tropical forests is ongoing. This may have important implications for our understanding of ''sustainable forest development'' and for the design of both conservation and poverty-alleviation strategies.","|Fo|","|",,"10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00070-5","|O0014/EDI|",". wunder s poverty alleviation and tropical forests what scope for synergies world development elsevier science ltd uk this paper explores the state of the art of the two way causal links between poverty alleviation and natural tropical forests microimpacts of rising poverty can increase or slow forest loss at the macrolevel poverty also has an ambiguous effect but it is probable that higher income stimulates forest loss by raising demand for agricultural land the second question is what potential forest led development has to alleviate a country s poverty in terms of producer benefits consumer benefits and economy wide employment natural forests widely serve as safety nets for the rural poor but it proves difficult to raise producer benefits significantly urban consumer benefits from forest an important target for pro poor agricultural innovation are limited and seldom favor the poor absorption of poor unskilled labor is low in forestry which tends to be capital intensive natural forests may thus lack comparative advantage for poverty alleviation there are few win win synergies between natural forests and national poverty reduction which may help to explain why the loss of tropical forests is ongoing this may have important implications for our understanding of sustainable forest development and for the design of both conservation and poverty alleviation strategies doi 10 1016 s0305 750x 01 00070 5 o0014 ed .",,

While the threats to various components of biodiversity vary according to region, the principal underlying threats are human population dynamics; wealth, poverty and inequity; consumer attitudes and preferences; and market failures and policy distortions. Attempts to prioritise areas for biodiversity conservation have concentrated on areas of high diversity of biodiversity components and do not include evaluation of the ecosystem services provided.

Definitions are clarified and the key concepts and indicators related to livelihoods and policy reduction and prevention are explored--distinguishing between the analysis and the measurements of poverty. Reviewing the macro-level literature on the relationship between economic growth, inequality and poverty, the authors found that economic growth usually does trickle down to the poor and that poverty reduction without growth is in practice very difficult to achieve. The potentials and limitations of forests in regard to poverty allevition are canvassed and their possible roles as safety nets, poverty traps and pathways out of poverty are explored. The core discussion addresses how forests can contribute to poverty reduction, distinguishing three main benefit categories. Firstly, non-timber forest products serve subsistence needs, may have important gap filling or safety net functions. Secondly, timber has not traditionally been very pro-poor but the current trends of increased local ownership of natural forests, growing tree commercialisation and small scale wood processing could modify that picture. Thirdly, ecological service payments are emerging rapidly but it is uncertain how much the poor will benefit. In conclusion, this paper outlines ten promising research topics, within three broader fields: assessing current forest-based benefits to the poor; exploring emerging market opportunities; and evaluating cross-cutting institutional and extra-sectoral issues.","|Fo|PE|","|","http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-40.pdf",,"|O0014/EDI|",". angelsen a wunder s exploring the forest poverty link key concepts issues and research implications occasional paper cifor bogor indonesia this paper provides a global review of the link from forests to poverty alleviation definitions are clarified and the key concepts and indicators related to livelihoods and policy reduction and prevention are explored distinguishing between the analysis and the measurements of poverty reviewing the macro level literature on the relationship between economic growth inequality and poverty the authors found that economic growth usually does trickle down to the poor and that poverty reduction without growth is in practice very difficult to achieve the potentials and limitations of forests in regard to poverty allevition are canvassed and their possible roles as safety nets poverty traps and pathways out of poverty are explored the core discussion addresses how forests can contribute to poverty reduction distinguishing three main benefit categories firstly non timber forest products serve subsistence needs may have important gap filling or safety net functions secondly timber has not traditionally been very pro poor but the current trends of increased local ownership of natural forests growing tree commercialisation and small scale wood processing could modify that picture thirdly ecological service payments are emerging rapidly but it is uncertain how much the poor will benefit in conclusion this paper outlines ten promising research topics within three broader fields assessing current forest based benefits to the poor; exploring emerging market opportunities; and evaluating cross cutting institutional and extra sectoral issues http www cifor cgiar org publications pdf_files occpapers op 40 pdf o0014 ed .",,

For example, two international workshops were organized by CIFOR in 1995 and another the following year to analyse key research issues in the field of NTFP development. These workshops recognised that the process of NTFP commercialisation interacts with people's welfare, forest management, tenure and control of resources, and forest structure and function (through ecological processes). Earlier review and analysis had generated a number of hypotheses, theories and conclusions related to the effects of commercialisation. Forest and resource tenure are likely to both affect the way a resource is managed and utilised, and be affected by changes in value due to commercialisation. Many authors have suggested that NTFP harvesting will be less damaging to biodiversity and other environmental values than management for timber. Others suggest that market pressures are likely to lead to the decline and eventual disappearance of valuable products and to severe impacts on the ecosystem. While there is a growing understanding (and acceptance) of the economic importance of forest products, especially for the poor, the potential impact of NTFP commercialisation needs to be better understood. A recommendation from the workshops was to undertake a thorough overview of the available literature to synthesise the key lessons about these areas of interaction. Such a review would critically examine the available information and analyses and identify key research areas needing further attention.","|MA|","|","http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/publications/pdf_files/mgntfp3.pdf",,"|O0014/EDI|O0021/EDI|",". neumann r p hirsch e commercialisation of non timber forest products review and analysis of research cifor bogor indonesia this study is one in a series of activities undertaken by cifor to reach a better understanding of the impact of commercialisation on forest resources and what factors influence the market demand for forest products for example two international workshops were organized by cifor in 1995 and another the following year to analyse key research issues in the field of ntfp development these workshops recognised that the process of ntfp commercialisation interacts with people s welfare forest management tenure and control of resources and forest structure and function through ecological processes earlier review and analysis had generated a number of hypotheses theories and conclusions related to the effects of commercialisation forest and resource tenure are likely to both affect the way a resource is managed and utilised and be affected by changes in value due to commercialisation many authors have suggested that ntfp harvesting will be less damaging to biodiversity and other environmental values than management for timber others suggest that market pressures are likely to lead to the decline and eventual disappearance of valuable products and to severe impacts on the ecosystem while there is a growing understanding and acceptance of the economic importance of forest products especially for the poor the potential impact of ntfp commercialisation needs to be better understood a recommendation from the workshops was to undertake a thorough overview of the available literature to synthesise the key lessons about these areas of interaction such a review would critically examine the available information and analyses and identify key research areas needing further attention http www cifor cgiar org publications pdf_files mgntfp3 pdf o0014 ed o0021 ed .",,

The number of national and transboundary protected area projects in Central Africa is growing rapidly to respond to heightened threats to forest biodiversity, and conservation organisations are working hard to generate the necessary resources to enable these projects to be more sustainable. However, many of these conservation projects overlap lands owned or claimed by local communities, especially an estimated 500,000 indigenous “Pygmy” hunter-gatherers living in the CEFDHAC countries, and the impacts of conservation on these communities are often very severe, placing these indigenous communities’ needs squarely on international donors’ poverty alleviation agendas. Work over the past four years by FPP and its partners shows how widely agreed international principles recognising the rights of indigenous peoples to use, own and control their traditional territories, and to protect their traditional knowledge and skills, and which espouse the development of working partnership with indigenous people based upon the principle of full informed consent, are not being applied properly by governments and conservation agencies, even though they have already been agreed by them. The reasons for this failure are complex, and related to the need for revision of conservation project practices and legislative measures concerning communities’ land rights. This briefing concludes that solutions supporting community rights and biodiversity are now within reach. This conference is an important opportunity to promote a shift in favour of both communities’ rights, as well as the long-term and sustainable conservation of biodiversity. FPP will continue to support efforts to help its partners in CEFDHAC participating countries to develop the necessary dialogue with conservation organisations on these issues in order to promote both the interests of their communities and the protection of their environment.","|CG|IR|","|002-017-|","http://www.forestpeoples.org/documents/africa/cefdhac_5_ip_rights_biodiversity_may04_eng.shtml",,"|O0024/IPL|",". nelson j conservation and communities in central africa the need to secure indigenous rights and biodiversity briefing for the 5th cefdhac meeting yaounde cameroon 24 26 may 2004 forest peoples programme moreton in marsh this briefing for the 5th cefdhac conference highlights key areas of concern related to the rights of indigenous forest communities in central africa who face serious discrimination from society are treated as inferior and exploited by their neighbours and are persistently neglected by development projects the number of national and transboundary protected area projects in central africa is growing rapidly to respond to heightened threats to forest biodiversity and conservation organisations are working hard to generate the necessary resources to enable these projects to be more sustainable however many of these conservation projects overlap lands owned or claimed by local communities especially an estimated 500 000 indigenous “pygmy” hunter gatherers living in the cefdhac countries and the impacts of conservation on these communities are often very severe placing these indigenous communities’ needs squarely on international donors’ poverty alleviation agendas work over the past four years by fpp and its partners shows how widely agreed international principles recognising the rights of indigenous peoples to use own and control their traditional territories and to protect their traditional knowledge and skills and which espouse the development of working partnership with indigenous people based upon the principle of full informed consent are not being applied properly by governments and conservation agencies even though they have already been agreed by them the reasons for this failure are complex and related to the need for revision of conservation project practices and legislative measures concerning communities’ land rights this briefing concludes that solutions supporting community rights and biodiversity are now within reach this conference is an important opportunity to promote a shift in favour of both communities’ rights as well as the long term and sustainable conservation of biodiversity fpp will continue to support efforts to help its partners in cefdhac participating countries to develop the necessary dialogue with conservation organisations on these issues in order to promote both the interests of their communities and the protection of their environment http www forestpeoples org documents africa cefdhac_5_ip_rights_biodiversity_may04_eng shtml o0024 ip .",,

Efforts in the region have been aimed at two distinct applications. This paper looks at the requirements for developing artisanal seaweed cultivation as a source of income for coastal communities. The experience of the past 20 years shows that development projects in the region have focused mainly on technological aspects of cultivation and have been successful in addressing issues of species and strain selection, propagation methods and materials, site requirements, plot maintenance and initial post-harvest processing. Despite these advances commercial development has been slow but it remains apparent that there is potential for expansion of this activity. In order to realize this potential the transfer of the technology needs to be supported by a better understanding of the institutional, social and economic factors that are critical to its success. These include the identification of appropriate target groups for extension projects, the availability and type of training and technical support needed, the securing of rights of access and tenure, the management of potential conflicts over the use of sea space, and the identification of local and export markets and mechanisms to access them. A research project underway in St. Lucia includes an experiment that is testing the cultivation of species currently in high demand in the region and formulating a plan to define how a coastal community can maximize the benefits generated from seaweed cultivation. The paper describes the main questions addressed by the project, and the method and process used in this research.","|MA|","|019-419-029|","http://www.canari.org/seaweedcultivation.pdf",,"|O0119/EDI|",". smith a h renard y seaweed cultivation as a livelihood in caribbean coastal communities technical report canari seaweed cultivation has been tried in the caribbean since the 1970s efforts in the region have been aimed at two distinct applications this paper looks at the requirements for developing artisanal seaweed cultivation as a source of income for coastal communities the experience of the past 20 years shows that development projects in the region have focused mainly on technological aspects of cultivation and have been successful in addressing issues of species and strain selection propagation methods and materials site requirements plot maintenance and initial post harvest processing despite these advances commercial development has been slow but it remains apparent that there is potential for expansion of this activity in order to realize this potential the transfer of the technology needs to be supported by a better understanding of the institutional social and economic factors that are critical to its success these include the identification of appropriate target groups for extension projects the availability and type of training and technical support needed the securing of rights of access and tenure the management of potential conflicts over the use of sea space and the identification of local and export markets and mechanisms to access them a research project underway in st lucia includes an experiment that is testing the cultivation of species currently in high demand in the region and formulating a plan to define how a coastal community can maximize the benefits generated from seaweed cultivation the paper describes the main questions addressed by the project and the method and process used in this research http www canari org seaweedcultivation pdf o0119 ed .",,

The solutions are therefore obvious-fewer people and more development. This book challenges these assumptions. Deforestation, it argues, is an expression of structural inequalities within tropical countries and in their relations with the industrial North. Throwing aid money into the development pot will only accelerate forest loss if these structural issues are not simultaneously addressed. Based on six country studies from Latin America, Asia and Africa to illustrate the real complexity of the problem and the diversity of situations that exist, this book shows how land concentration, land speculation and landlessness are the main causes of improvident land use. Poor people, denied land and livelihood, are being forced into the forests in ever increasing numbers for sheer survival, often encouraged by government and development agency funding.

It defines the links between poverty, and the environment, and, demonstrates that sound, and equitable management of the environment is integral to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, in particular to eradicating extreme poverty, and hunger, reducing child mortality, combating major diseases, and ensuring environmental sustainability. Priorities for a sustained policy, and institutional change highlight governance improvement, enhanced assets of the poor, improved growth quality, and, reform international, and industrial country policies to address poverty, and environment concerns. To this end, the document emphasizes that policy opportunities exist, stipulating that poor people must be seen as part of the solution, rather than part of the problem; that environmental quality of growth matters to the poor; and, that environmental management cannot be treated separately from other development concerns. For improving governance, suggestions include the integration of poverty-environment issues into national development frameworks, and strengthening decentralization for environmental management, by empowering civil society, in particular marginal groups, and addressing gender dimensions of poverty-environment issues. The assets of the poor can be enhanced by strengthening the resources rights of the poor, and enhancing capacity to manage the environment, and expand access to environmentally sound, appropriate technology. By integrating poverty-environmental issues, encouraged by private sector involvement, into economic policy reforms, the quality of growth can be improved.

The authors reviewed nearly 300 published and Internet documents on various aspects of poverty in fisheries and on lessons learned of poverty alleviation measures and approaches including the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA). The principal findings of this review, undertaken within a short period of time, indicate important research and policy issues. There are very few studies and analyses on the extent, nature, causes and dynamics of poverty in fishing communities. Similarly, the extent to which the fisheries sector and its various linked activities (e.g. fish processing, marketing and distribution) contribute to poverty alleviation and food security has been subject to limited study. On the other hand, the literature abounds with statements, largely unsupported by empirical evidence, that suggest that fishing communities belong to the poor, or poorest, strata of society. There is also limited understanding on the impact on poverty (incidence, depth and dynamics) of technological change, community and fishers' organizations, and alternative fisheries management governance regimes. On the policy side, the review found that while government but especially donor-supported fisheries development and management programmes usually seek, at least implicitly, to reduce poverty in fishing communities, these programmes are rarely targeted on the poor. While empirical evidence is still very limited because of its newness, the SLA is an improvement over conventional sectoral approaches for combating poverty in fishing communities. The main advantages of the SLA lie in its multi-sectoral and integrated nature and its foundation in stakeholder participation. However, application of SLA to guide interventions and policy must be adaptive and flexible, which increases time and costs. Poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), currently in preparation in many of the poorest developing countries, have so far made little explicit reference to livelihoods in small-scale fisheries. While the SLA is thought to offer great potential to contribute to improving the relevance of PRSPs, there is some concern over the extent to which SL principles are currently incorporated in PRSPs.","|MA|CS|","|","http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/005/Y3914E/Y3914E00.HTM",,"|O0021/EDI|",". macfadyen g corcoran e literature review of studies on poverty in fishing communities and of lessons learned in using the sustainable livelihoods approach in poverty alleviation strategies and projects fao fisheries circular fao rome this report presents the findings of a literature review conducted on behalf of the dfid fao sustainable fisheries livelihoods programme sflp the authors reviewed nearly 300 published and internet documents on various aspects of poverty in fisheries and on lessons learned of poverty alleviation measures and approaches including the sustainable livelihoods approach sla the principal findings of this review undertaken within a short period of time indicate important research and policy issues there are very few studies and analyses on the extent nature causes and dynamics of poverty in fishing communities similarly the extent to which the fisheries sector and its various linked activities e g fish processing marketing and distribution contribute to poverty alleviation and food security has been subject to limited study on the other hand the literature abounds with statements largely unsupported by empirical evidence that suggest that fishing communities belong to the poor or poorest strata of society there is also limited understanding on the impact on poverty incidence depth and dynamics of technological change community and fishers organizations and alternative fisheries management governance regimes on the policy side the review found that while government but especially donor supported fisheries development and management programmes usually seek at least implicitly to reduce poverty in fishing communities these programmes are rarely targeted on the poor while empirical evidence is still very limited because of its newness the sla is an improvement over conventional sectoral approaches for combating poverty in fishing communities the main advantages of the sla lie in its multi sectoral and integrated nature and its foundation in stakeholder participation however application of sla to guide interventions and policy must be adaptive and flexible which increases time and costs poverty reduction strategy papers prsps currently in preparation in many of the poorest developing countries have so far made little explicit reference to livelihoods in small scale fisheries while the sla is thought to offer great potential to contribute to improving the relevance of prsps there is some concern over the extent to which sl principles are currently incorporated in prsps http www fao org documents show_cdr asp url_file= docrep 005 y3914e y3914e00 htm o0021 ed .",,

Nevertheless, while evidence indicates that the fisheries sector can contribute (often markedly at the local level) to improved livelihoods and the achievement of food security in many developing countries, the sector is often neglected in PRSPs. This Circular first identifies of 129 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, economies in transition and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) the significance of the fisheries sector as motor of economic growth or likely poverty refuge. Secondly, it examines the extent to which National Development Plans (NDPs), PRSPs, Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) of the European Union and other donor support programmes have presently incorporated the fisheries sector into such documents. Subsequently, a comparison with data indicating the importance of the sector to the national economy (in terms of generating foreign exchange and/or supporting domestic protein consumption levels) enables to pinpoint those countries with substantive fisheries sectors, but a correspondingly lower than expected degree of sectoral mainstreaming in NDPs, PRSPs and CSPs, and allows to identify countries which are currently 'punching above their weight' in this respect. Findings are discussed on a regional basis – regional averages suggesting that the sector has been most effectively mainstreamed in Asia (case of PRSPs, NDPs and the World Bank donor support strategies) – closely followed by the African economies and the SIDS. In contrast Latin America, home to two of the top six global fishing nations (Chile and Peru), scores extremely poorly as far as mainstreaming the fisheries sector in PRSPs and NDPs concerns.","|MA|","|","ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/y5930e/y5930e00.pdf",,"|O0021/EDI|",".  thorpe a mainstreaming fisheries into national development and poverty reduction startegies current situation and opportunities fao rome the formulation of poverty reduction strategy papers prsps is one of the main conditions for concessional lending by the international monetary fund imf and the world bank to developing countries nevertheless while evidence indicates that the fisheries sector can contribute often markedly at the local level to improved livelihoods and the achievement of food security in many developing countries the sector is often neglected in prsps this circular first identifies of 129 countries in africa asia latin america economies in transition and small island developing states sids the significance of the fisheries sector as motor of economic growth or likely poverty refuge secondly it examines the extent to which national development plans ndps prsps country strategy papers csps of the european union and other donor support programmes have presently incorporated the fisheries sector into such documents subsequently a comparison with data indicating the importance of the sector to the national economy in terms of generating foreign exchange and or supporting domestic protein consumption levels enables to pinpoint those countries with substantive fisheries sectors but a correspondingly lower than expected degree of sectoral mainstreaming in ndps prsps and csps and allows to identify countries which are currently punching above their weight in this respect findings are discussed on a regional basis – regional averages suggesting that the sector has been most effectively mainstreamed in asia case of prsps ndps and the world bank donor support strategies – closely followed by the african economies and the sids in contrast latin america home to two of the top six global fishing nations chile and peru scores extremely poorly as far as mainstreaming the fisheries sector in prsps and ndps concerns ftp ftp fao org docrep fao 008 y5930e y5930e00 pdf o0021 edi  .",,

One of the major reasons for failure was that the national land laws in effect at the time did not allow the purchase of land titles. Recently, Perú has instituted a process for the purchase of land titles in the rainforest. One lodge has used the new land tenure laws with some success to create a rainforest reserve.

The extent to which the legal harvest of marine turtle eggs in Ostional, Costa Rica, is an example of sustainable use and community based conservation is evaluated in this paper. Field research using in-depth interviewing and a household questionnaire was undertaken in Ostional during 1994 and 1995, to investigate local perceptions of the egg harvesting project, both positive and negative. Socio-economic benefits from, and legal and administrative structures supporting, the project were found to be fundamental to community support for a limited egg harvest and allowed for community participation in, and control of, resource use. Participation and control were key to local support for conservation of nesting marine turtles and their eggs. Attempts to use wildlife sustainably must be considered on a case by case basis, to account for the biological nature of the wildlife resource and environment in question and for local socio-economic, political and historical conditions.

Attempts were made to reduce conflicts between elephants and farmers using deterrents such as electrical fencing, trip-alarm techniques and elephant warning calls. Success of deterrents depended on the frequency of exposure to elephants, maintenance and the ecology of both humans and elephants in the region. Of the deterrent strategies explored, only electrical fencing reduced elephant damage at the community level.

We found that intensive management of Euterpe oleracea (Palmae) fruit, one of the most important extractive products in the Amazon, has substantial impacts on biodiversity, whereas moderate management does not. We mimicked traditional levels of fruit harvest in a replicated experiment over one fruiting season. High-intensity harvest (75% of fruits removed) reduced avian frugivore species diversity by 22%. Low-intensity harvest (40% of fruits removed), however, had no effect on diversity. On a larger scale, we found that forests with enriched densities of E. oleracea supported more fruit-eating birds but fewer non fruit-eating birds than nonenriched forests.

We studied the demographic effect and economic returns of harvesting aromatic gaharu wood from fungus-infected trees of Aquilaria malaccensis Lam. at Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesia, to evaluate the management potential of gaharu wood. Aquilaria malaccensis trees openface> 20 cm in diameter occurred at low preharvest densities (0.16–0.32 ha) but were distributed across five of six forest types surveyed. During a recent harvest, 75% of trees were felled, with harvest intensities ranging from 50% to 100% among forest types. Overall, 50% of trees contained gaharu wood, but trees at higher elevations contained gaharu wood more frequently ( 73%) than trees at lower elevation (27%). The mean density of regeneration ( juveniles> 15 cm in height) near adult trees (3–7 m away) was 0.2/m2, 200 times greater than at random in the forest (10/ha), but long-term data on growth and survivorship are needed to determine whether regeneration is sufficient for population recovery. Gaharu wood extraction from Gunung Palung was very profitable for collectors, generating an estimated gross financial return per day of US $8.80, triple the mean village wage.

It focuses on the different actors, organisations and projects concerned with extractive reserves in Rondônia in western Amazonia, Brazil. Extractive reserves are supported by a wide range of different actors and agencies, within a rapidly evolving institutional context. Extractive reserves are widely seen as a means of integrating forest conservation and local socio-economic development. As such, they have gained the support of the international environmental movement, multilateral and state development organisations, and grassroots community and producer organisations. These institutions represent a vast array of diverse interests which range from conservation of biodiversity, economic and social cohesion, and regional and national development. Extractive reserves are promoted as a means to achieve each of these objectives. However these ends are not necessarily complementary or compatible, and the integration of conservation and development is by no means easy to achieve. Whilst the various actors and institutions claim mutual and complementary interests, they form shifting alliances and coalitions in order to further their interests. This paper maps these institutions and interests and describes how alliances have been formed and broken, and how this has contributed to the currently observed implementation of extractive reserves. It analyses how the evolving institutions have been able to forward sustainable development in Amazonia and who benefits from alliances and coalitions. The paper argues that extractive reserves are constrained by the dissonance or misfit in discourses and underlying worldviews, reflected by the aims and objectives of the institutions which promote, oppose and lose or benefit from their implementation. This misfit is overcome, in part, by alliances formed between the differentm institutions, and in part by the creation of new institutions and projects.","|OR|CS|","|019-005-076|","http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-4959.2000.tb00005.x",,"|O0265/OPE|O0250/OPE|",". brown k rosendo s the institutional architecture of extractive reserves in rondonia brazil the geographical journal blackwell publishing this paper examines the evolution and development of institutions involved in the establishment of extractive reserves it focuses on the different actors organisations and projects concerned with extractive reserves in rondônia in western amazonia brazil extractive reserves are supported by a wide range of different actors and agencies within a rapidly evolving institutional context extractive reserves are widely seen as a means of integrating forest conservation and local socio economic development as such they have gained the support of the international environmental movement multilateral and state development organisations and grassroots community and producer organisations these institutions represent a vast array of diverse interests which range from conservation of biodiversity economic and social cohesion and regional and national development extractive reserves are promoted as a means to achieve each of these objectives however these ends are not necessarily complementary or compatible and the integration of conservation and development is by no means easy to achieve whilst the various actors and institutions claim mutual and complementary interests they form shifting alliances and coalitions in order to further their interests this paper maps these institutions and interests and describes how alliances have been formed and broken and how this has contributed to the currently observed implementation of extractive reserves it analyses how the evolving institutions have been able to forward sustainable development in amazonia and who benefits from alliances and coalitions the paper argues that extractive reserves are constrained by the dissonance or misfit in discourses and underlying worldviews reflected by the aims and objectives of the institutions which promote oppose and lose or benefit from their implementation this misfit is overcome in part by alliances formed between the differentm institutions and in part by the creation of new institutions and projects http www blackwell synergy com doi abs 10 1111 j 1475 4959 2000 tb00005 x o0265 ac o0250 ac .",,

The groves contained 650–700 rubber trees with a dbh >10 cm per ha, plus variable numbers of smaller rubber trees. Rubber trees contributed 72–97% to the total basal area of the groves. Average dry rubber production per grove varied between 30 and 75 g per tree per week, with an average of 50 g. Income from rubber tapping at the present level of productivitywas unlikely to exceed one Brazilian minimum salary for most farmers. Stimulation of the latex flux with a conventional chemical stimulant, ethephon, increased rubber production per week by up to 38%, but the response was highly variable between groves. The attempt to substitute the chemical stimulant by a locally produced, biological product was unsuccessful. There seemed to be considerable potential for improving tree health while increasing rubber production per unit time through the use of improved tapping practices, especially for old trees. From the two tapping knives and methods that are used in the region, the Amazonian method gave significantly higher yields per tree than the southeast Asian method; this adds to better protection of the trees from panel diseases and therefore greater longevity of the groves. Stem diameter, crown form and crown position of the rubber trees were all significantly related to rubber production, suggesting that too early tapping (which reduces growth) and excessively dense stands should be avoided; however, the predictive power of these variables was mpoor, and this may explain why farmers are reluctant to thin their stands and believe that mature rubber trees are not negatively affected by a secondary forest environment. Even in groves with low average productivity some very high-yielding trees were found, with the most productive ones attaining 250–300 g of dry rubber per tree per week. This points to a considerable value of these traditional agroforests as genetic reservoirs, and to opportunities to establish more productive groves through a rigorous process of seed and plant selection, without the need to drastically alter the traditional agroforestry practices.","|CS|Fo|","|019-005-076|",,"10.1016/j.agee.2003.09.001","|",". schroth g moraes v h f da mota m s s increasing the profitability of traditional planted rubber agroforests at the tapajos river brazilian amazon agriculture ecosystems and environment elsevier science ltd uk the planted rubber agroforests of the tapajós region in eastern pará state brazilian amazon are a traditional land use practice of intermediate intensity between extractivism in natural forest and plantation agriculture and thus of potential interest especially for inhabited conservation areas and extractive reserves we measured rubber production of five groves of 23–40 years of age on representative soil types and landscape positions of the region during one tapping season and tested options for improving rubber production in a series of on farm experiments the groves contained 650–700 rubber trees with a dbh >10 cm per ha plus variable numbers of smaller rubber trees rubber trees contributed 72–97% to the total basal area of the groves average dry rubber production per grove varied between 30 and 75 g per tree per week with an average of 50 g income from rubber tapping at the present level of productivitywas unlikely to exceed one brazilian minimum salary for most farmers stimulation of the latex flux with a conventional chemical stimulant ethephon increased rubber production per week by up to 38% but the response was highly variable between groves the attempt to substitute the chemical stimulant by a locally produced biological product was unsuccessful there seemed to be considerable potential for improving tree health while increasing rubber production per unit time through the use of improved tapping practices especially for old trees from the two tapping knives and methods that are used in the region the amazonian method gave significantly higher yields per tree than the southeast asian method; this adds to better protection of the trees from panel diseases and therefore greater longevity of the groves stem diameter crown form and crown position of the rubber trees were all significantly related to rubber production suggesting that too early tapping which reduces growth and excessively dense stands should be avoided; however the predictive power of these variables was mpoor and this may explain why farmers are reluctant to thin their stands and believe that mature rubber trees are not negatively affected by a secondary forest environment even in groves with low average productivity some very high yielding trees were found with the most productive ones attaining 250–300 g of dry rubber per tree per week this points to a considerable value of these traditional agroforests as genetic reservoirs and to opportunities to establish more productive groves through a rigorous process of seed and plant selection without the need to drastically alter the traditional agroforestry practices doi 10 1016 j agee 2003 09 001 .",,

In Tanzania, the inception of the 1998 national forest policy has led to institutionalisation of community-based forest management (CBFM) and joint forest management (JFM). A number of years later, it is worth assessing the impact of this policy on the resource base and people’s livelihoods. This paper uses two case studies of forest reserves under participatory forest management to explore this issue. Secondary data was gathered from various studies conducted in those two forest reserves. In addition to the analysis carried out by the various authors, further analysis involving content and structural analysis and synthesis of documented information was done. The results of the study revealed that CBFM at Duru-Haitemba had a positive impact on the resource base and people’s livelihoods – the forest is healthier than before and people are satisfied with the products they collect from the forests. On the other hand, the impact of JFM at Kwizu Forest Reserve has not yet produced desirable results since illegal activities are still rampant and, apparently, forest exploitation has increased instead of decreasing. The reasons behind the success at Duru-Haitemba and relative failure at Kwizu are varied, but are most probably linked to ownership of resources and law enforcement. Clear definition of rights, returns and responsibilities and adequate incentives are important for sustainability of people-centred management of natural resources.","|CS|Fo|","|002-014-834|",,,"|O0345/OPE|O0344/OPE|",".  kajembe g c nduwamungu j luoga e j the impact of community based forest management and joint forest management on forest resource base and local peoples’ livelihoods case studies from tanzania commons southern africa occasional paper series cass plaas in recent years there has been a move in eastern and southern african countries from centralised and state driven management of natural resources towards decentralised and people centred based regimes in tanzania the inception of the 1998 national forest policy has led to institutionalisation of community based forest management cbfm and joint forest management jfm a number of years later it is worth assessing the impact of this policy on the resource base and people’s livelihoods this paper uses two case studies of forest reserves under participatory forest management to explore this issue secondary data was gathered from various studies conducted in those two forest reserves in addition to the analysis carried out by the various authors further analysis involving content and structural analysis and synthesis of documented information was done the results of the study revealed that cbfm at duru haitemba had a positive impact on the resource base and people’s livelihoods – the forest is healthier than before and people are satisfied with the products they collect from the forests on the other hand the impact of jfm at kwizu forest reserve has not yet produced desirable results since illegal activities are still rampant and apparently forest exploitation has increased instead of decreasing the reasons behind the success at duru haitemba and relative failure at kwizu are varied but are most probably linked to ownership of resources and law enforcement clear definition of rights returns and responsibilities and adequate incentives are important for sustainability of people centred management of natural resources o0345 ope o0344 ope  .",,

One key finding is that domestic and export demand for Chinese manufactured wood products will continue to grow dramatically, so, in turn, will the demand for both home-grown and imported timber. The authors hope this paper will help governments, industry and civil society gain a clearer understanding of their respective roles in the global timber market, and that it will help them to take an important leadership role in helping to transform the forest products market to one that not only ensures sustainable forestry and conservation, but to one that provides satisfactory livelihood opportunities for forest dependent communities, and promotes sustainable economic development for all nations.","|Fo|","|142-030-156|","Forest Trends <BR>Email: publications@forest-trends.org",,"|O0025/EDI|",". white a xiufang sun canby k jintao xu barr c cossalter c nilsson s china and the global market for forest products transforming trade to benefit forests and livelihoods forest trends washington d c china has become a leading nation in terms of its demand for forest products in many supplier countries particularly those with weak governance records the increasing trade flows into china are associated with unsustainable harvesting illegal logging and the abuse of forest communities’ rights however china’s growing demand also creates the possibility that millions of low income forest producers can benefit from this new market trees and forests are the primary asset of millions of the world’s poorest people and when governments enable the poor to use them wisely they can be an important instrument of rural development china is now in the world’s spotlight with governments industry and development agencies eager to learn more about the global impact the country is having on forests and forest industries this paper and the body of research it represents aims to help fill the knowledge gap it is an overview of the key findings of many research studies conducted by forest trends the center for chinese agricultural policy ccap the center for international forestry research cifor and their many partners in china and the asia pacific region the synthesis of this research presents a wake up call for the global forestry community one key finding is that domestic and export demand for chinese manufactured wood products will continue to grow dramatically so in turn will the demand for both home grown and imported timber the authors hope this paper will help governments industry and civil society gain a clearer understanding of their respective roles in the global timber market and that it will help them to take an important leadership role in helping to transform the forest products market to one that not only ensures sustainable forestry and conservation but to one that provides satisfactory livelihood opportunities for forest dependent communities and promotes sustainable economic development for all nations forest trends email publications forest trends org o0025 ed .",,

The obstacles to implementing decentralization were due mainly to the inconsistency of national laws and regulations, unclear division of responsibility and authority between district, provincial and central governments, an unfair balancing mechanism for reforestation funds between producing and non-producing districts, increased claims of tenure by local communities, low levels of public participation in decision-making processes and a lack of spatial planning at the district level. By using an inclusive decision-making process for the research process, this study helped the district government and local communities to look at underlying causes of problems in implementing forestry sector decentralization in their areas and to find alternative solutions to these problems. As a result, the district Forestry Office has undertaken many activities in direct response to the outcomes of this research project, such as a social forestry programme for local forest-dependent communities and the adoption of more inclusive processes for district forestry planning. There have also been changes in attitudes to customary rights over natural resources, and the provision of technical assistance and capacity building for rural forest dependent farmers.

But what real PES experiences are actually out there? This work assesses a range of PES or PES-type experiences in one country, Bolivia, in the fields of carbon sequestration, protection of watershed services, biodiversity and aesthetic landscape values. The report concludes that while none of the generally young initiatives adhere fully to the principle of PES as developed in the theoretical literature, many experiment with some of the relevant PES mechanisms. Protection of watersheds and landscape values are the most common types, though the implementing intermediaries often have underlying biodiversity-protection goals. Main obstacles to PES implementation include ideological resistance against the PES concept, the difficulty of building trust between buyers and sellers, and limited willingness to pay on behalf of service users. During their relatively short lifetime, basically all initiatives had been successful in making service sellers (PES recipients) better off in economic terms, while the effectiveness in achieving environmental objectives and securing positive social impacts so far remained more variable. In some cases, redesigning these initiatives to bring them closer to the full PES principles could also enable them to more effectively achieve positive environmental and livelihood outcomes.","|MA|","|019-005-068|","http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/BRobertson0501.pdf",,"|",". robertson n wunder s fresh tracks in the forest assessing incipient payments for environmental services initiatives in bolivia cifor bogor indonesia payments for environmental services pes are being considered worldwide with great interest and expectation proposals to create agreements in which beneficiaries of environmental services pay landowners directly for the provision or protection of these services are innovative and promising but what real pes experiences are actually out there this work assesses a range of pes or pes type experiences in one country bolivia in the fields of carbon sequestration protection of watershed services biodiversity and aesthetic landscape values the report concludes that while none of the generally young initiatives adhere fully to the principle of pes as developed in the theoretical literature many experiment with some of the relevant pes mechanisms protection of watersheds and landscape values are the most common types though the implementing intermediaries often have underlying biodiversity protection goals main obstacles to pes implementation include ideological resistance against the pes concept the difficulty of building trust between buyers and sellers and limited willingness to pay on behalf of service users during their relatively short lifetime basically all initiatives had been successful in making service sellers pes recipients better off in economic terms while the effectiveness in achieving environmental objectives and securing positive social impacts so far remained more variable in some cases redesigning these initiatives to bring them closer to the full pes principles could also enable them to more effectively achieve positive environmental and livelihood outcomes http www cifor cgiar org publications pdf_files books brobertson0501 pdf .",,

It studies the advantages and problems associated with the current forestry management system. The most significant change following special autonomy for Papua was the introduction of small-scale concession permits granted to community cooperatives, locally known as Kopermas. As a result, CIFOR and the State University of Papua’s research focused on these Kopermas, analyzing data on timber production and revenues from concessions, and determining the flow of benefits to customary communities’ incomes and to regional revenues. The objective was to determine how effectively the Kopermas system has empowered local communities. Using a combination of conventional and participatory/action research methods, the research team evaluated the livelihoods and environmental value of forest resources for local people. We also facilitated stakeholder input into our research findings and analysis. The team also worked with local communities to determine their current capacity for forest management; which mechanisms were used to distribute the benefits from the new system; and how people were involved in decision-making about permit applications and concession management. This research found some direct involvement of local people in forest management and short-term benefits for local communities. However, we also found that the benefits from timber revenues have not been fairly shared among local people and other actors involved in the timber business. As a result, community forestry cooperatives have yet to contribute to equitable and sustainable development for local people. To improve this situation, local stakeholders identified an urgent need to empower customary organizations and individuals by equipping them to manage their own natural resources independently. This will reduce the likelihood that communities are exploited by more powerful stakeholders in the future.","|Fo|GP|","|009-054-598|","http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/scripts/newscripts/publications/detail.asp?pid=1900",,"|O0014/EDI|",". tokede m j william d widodo gandhi y imburi c patriahadi marwa j yufuai m c the impact of special autonomy on papua’s forestry sector empowering customary communities masyarakat adat in decentralized forestry development in manokwari district case studies on decentralisation and forests in indonesia cifor bogor indonesia the report focuses on the impacts of special autonomy in papua on the forestry sector it studies the advantages and problems associated with the current forestry management system the most significant change following special autonomy for papua was the introduction of small scale concession permits granted to community cooperatives locally known as kopermas as a result cifor and the state university of papua’s research focused on these kopermas analyzing data on timber production and revenues from concessions and determining the flow of benefits to customary communities’ incomes and to regional revenues the objective was to determine how effectively the kopermas system has empowered local communities using a combination of conventional and participatory action research methods the research team evaluated the livelihoods and environmental value of forest resources for local people we also facilitated stakeholder input into our research findings and analysis the team also worked with local communities to determine their current capacity for forest management; which mechanisms were used to distribute the benefits from the new system; and how people were involved in decision making about permit applications and concession management this research found some direct involvement of local people in forest management and short term benefits for local communities however we also found that the benefits from timber revenues have not been fairly shared among local people and other actors involved in the timber business as a result community forestry cooperatives have yet to contribute to equitable and sustainable development for local people to improve this situation local stakeholders identified an urgent need to empower customary organizations and individuals by equipping them to manage their own natural resources independently this will reduce the likelihood that communities are exploited by more powerful stakeholders in the future http www cifor cgiar org scripts newscripts publications detail asp pid=1900 o0014 ed .",,

Illegal forestry activities cause massive environmental destruction, deprive governments of billions of dollars in lost revenues, unfairly favor those in a position to pay large bribes, and generally undermine the rule of law. Nevertheless, before start looking for ways to enforce existing forestry laws more vigorously, it is important to consider how that might affect poor rural households. Recent studies suggest that many forestry laws and regulations can discriminate against small producers and that a large number of people depend on small-scale illegal forestry activities to survive. It is possible that enforcing these laws might potentially harm poor people. It is also possible that some government authorities would selectively target small producers, truck drivers, and forestry workers—rather than the big players who are responsible for most of the real problems. Given that, it is important to understand what greater forest law enforcement might imply in different contexts and how to promote forest law enforcement and good governance in a way that can benefit the poor and help governments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Currently, several village communities are benefiting from these financial mechanisms, which should allow them to reduce their chronic poverty and to develop. However, this study – undertaken in the village of Kongo – indicates how these incomes are generally poorly managed and diverted by local elites.

Eloquent theoretical assessments have praised the absolute advantages of PES over traditional conservation approaches. Some pilot PES exist in the tropics, but many field practitioners and prospective service buyers and sellers remain skeptical about the concept. This paper aims to help demystify PES for non-economists, starting with a simple and coherent definition of the term. It then provides practical ‘how-to’ hints for PES design. It considers the likely niche for PES in the portfolio of conservation approaches. This assessment is based on a literature review, combined with field observations from research in Latin America and Asia. It concludes that service users will continue to drive PES, but their willingness to pay will only rise if schemes can demonstrate clear additionality vis-à-vis carefully established baselines, if trust-building processes with service providers are sustained, and PES recipients’ livelihood dynamics is better understood. PES best suits intermediate and/or projected threat scenarios, often in marginal lands with moderate conservation opportunity costs. People facing credible but medium-sized environmental degradation are more likely to become PES recipients than those living in relative harmony with Nature. The choice between PES cash and in-kind payments is highly context-dependent. Poor PES recipients are likely to gain from participation, though their access might be constrained and non-participating landless poor could lose out. PES is a highly promising conservation approach that can benefit buyers, sellers and improve the resource base, but it is unlikely to completely outstrip other conservation instruments.","|MA|","|","http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-42.pdf",,"|O0014/EDI|",". wunder s payments for environmental services some nuts and bolts wunder s cifor bogor indonesia payments for environmental services pes are part of a new and more direct conservation paradigm explicitly recognizing the need to bridge the interests of landowners and outsiders eloquent theoretical assessments have praised the absolute advantages of pes over traditional conservation approaches some pilot pes exist in the tropics but many field practitioners and prospective service buyers and sellers remain skeptical about the concept this paper aims to help demystify pes for non economists starting with a simple and coherent definition of the term it then provides practical ‘how to’ hints for pes design it considers the likely niche for pes in the portfolio of conservation approaches this assessment is based on a literature review combined with field observations from research in latin america and asia it concludes that service users will continue to drive pes but their willingness to pay will only rise if schemes can demonstrate clear additionality vis à vis carefully established baselines if trust building processes with service providers are sustained and pes recipients’ livelihood dynamics is better understood pes best suits intermediate and or projected threat scenarios often in marginal lands with moderate conservation opportunity costs people facing credible but medium sized environmental degradation are more likely to become pes recipients than those living in relative harmony with nature the choice between pes cash and in kind payments is highly context dependent poor pes recipients are likely to gain from participation though their access might be constrained and non participating landless poor could lose out pes is a highly promising conservation approach that can benefit buyers sellers and improve the resource base but it is unlikely to completely outstrip other conservation instruments http www cifor cgiar org publications pdf_files occpapers op 42 pdf o0014 ed .",,

This publication reviews the specific microfinance needs of small-scale enterprises given the often seasonal and unpredictable nature of forest-based activities. It analyses the constraints they face when trying to obtain microfinance services and identifies ways to overcome these challenges. The publication examines the role that different types of microfinance institutions, such as banks, non-governmental organizations, cooperatives and credit unions, can play for small-scale enterprises and forest communities. It discusses, in addition to microcredit, a comprehensive range of services including savings, group lending, leasing, insurance and cash transfers. The strengths and weaknesses of different approaches are illustrated through four case studies in Nepal, Guatemala, the Sudan and Peru.

In this context, Mexico presents a national laboratory for studying the social and ecological benefits of delivering forests to local people. As a little-noticed result of the Mexican Revolution in the second decade of the twentieth century, well over half of the forests of Mexico were placed in community-held lands. In historic struggles that passed through several phases, most of these communities have now gained substantial control over the use of their forests. Because of the substantial degree of social capital in rural forms of organization in Mexico, this control of forest resources has led to an estimated 290–479 community forest enterprises (CFEs), through which communities are producing timber on their own lands. New studies are beginning to suggest that important gains in both social and economic justice, good forest management, and biodiversity protection are resulting from the actions of these CFEs.

Yet the small-scale farmers who use slash-and-burn agriculture depend on it to produce food and make a living for their families. Balancing the legitimate interests of rural households and global concerns about tropical deforestation is one of the major challenges of the coming decades. The Alternatives to Slash and Burn (ASB) consortium was formed in 1992 by a group of concerned national and international research institutions to address the global and local issues associated with this form of agriculture. With contributions from agronomists, foresters, economists, ecologists, and anthropologists, this book synthesizes the first decade of ASB's work. It assesses the environmental, economic, and social impact of deforestation and identifies the costs and benefits of alternative uses of forests and cleared land.

With separate chapters on individual regions, including South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Africa, Rudel's work offers an up-to-date assessment of changes in the extent of the world's tropical forests. Through a meta-analysis, Rudel identifies the social, economic, and environmental forces driving forest cover change since 1980. In addition to synthesizing a range of local studies, Rudel recounts the stories of people whose work preserves, destroys, or restores forests. Rudel's explanation of what has happened in each of the world's tropical forest regions reveals continued destruction in regions with large forests and some regeneration emerging in places with small, remnant forests.

We develop a model where net returns to agriculture and fisheries are jointly maximized, taking into account the effect of flooding depth and timing on production, and value of catch in markets and for subsistence nutrition. Results for a region in Bangladesh show that optimal production in a natural floodplain yields higher net returns compared with a floodplain modified by flood control structures.

However information on the outcome of these approaches for conservation is often lacking. In this study, the effectiveness of community-based approaches for conservation of biodiversity was examined in Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) (Nepal) through a combination of ecological assessments and social surveys undertaken both within and outwith ACA. Forest basal area and tree species diversity were found to be significantly higher inside ACA than in neighbouring areas outside. The mean density of cut tree stumps was significantly lower inside ACA, associated with a decline in use of fuelwood as an energy source over the past decade. Social surveys also indicated that wild animal populations have increased inside ACA since the inception of community-based conservation. Observations of animal track counts, pellet counts and direct observations of selected species such as barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak) and Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) indicated higher abundances within ACA. The community-based management has been successful in delivering conservation benefits in ACA, attributable to changing patterns of resource use and behaviour among local communities, increased control of local communities over their local resources, increased conservation awareness among local people resulting from environmental education, and the development and strengthening of local institutions such as Conservation Area Management Committees (CAMC).

There has been concern that populations, and even species, are threatened by overexploitation but little is known about the harvest or its economic importance. We studied crayfish exploitation in eastern Madagascar over 3 years. The existence of local taboos (fady) preventing commercial crayfish harvesting, as well as access to markets and forest, influenced involvement in the harvest. All four crayfish species found in the region were harvested, but A. granulimanus provided the majority of the catch. In one harvesting village more than 50% of the 47 households were directly involved in the harvest, which contributed USD 2,382 to the village economy in 2003/2004, an important sum in the context of local incomes. Subsistence use was widespread, particularly by children to whom it may provide an important protein source. Community-based conservation (through transfer of harvesting rights and responsibilities for forest management to local communities) is central to a new conservation paradigm in Madagascar. This recognizes communities' long term interest in their natural resources and offers an ideal opportunity for those concerned with the sustainability of the harvest to implement management tools (such as avoiding reproductive females, size limits and no-take zones). We discuss each tool with respect to biological implications and practical constraints. We note that community-based approaches may not be sufficient to conserve rarer species, which make up a small proportion of the value of the harvest.","|MA|","|002-014-450|","Cambridge University Press<BR>Email: directcustserve@cambridge.org<BR>Phone: +44 (0)1223 326050",,"|O0261/OPE|O0294/OPE|O0354/OPE|",". jones j p g andriahajaina f b ranambinintsoa e h hockley n j ravoahangimalala o the economic importance of freshwater crayfish harvesting in madagascar and the potential of community based conservation to improve management oryx cambridge university press cmabridge uk madagascar s endemic freshwater crayfish parastacidae astacoides are harvested by local people for both subsistence use and small scale trade there has been concern that populations and even species are threatened by overexploitation but little is known about the harvest or its economic importance we studied crayfish exploitation in eastern madagascar over 3 years the existence of local taboos fady preventing commercial crayfish harvesting as well as access to markets and forest influenced involvement in the harvest all four crayfish species found in the region were harvested but a granulimanus provided the majority of the catch in one harvesting village more than 50% of the 47 households were directly involved in the harvest which contributed usd 2 382 to the village economy in 2003 2004 an important sum in the context of local incomes subsistence use was widespread particularly by children to whom it may provide an important protein source community based conservation through transfer of harvesting rights and responsibilities for forest management to local communities is central to a new conservation paradigm in madagascar this recognizes communities long term interest in their natural resources and offers an ideal opportunity for those concerned with the sustainability of the harvest to implement management tools such as avoiding reproductive females size limits and no take zones we discuss each tool with respect to biological implications and practical constraints we note that community based approaches may not be sufficient to conserve rarer species which make up a small proportion of the value of the harvest cambridge university press email directcustserve cambridge org phone 44 0 1223 326050 o0261 ac o0294 ac o0354 ac .",,

The construction of roads, schools and health centres, the provision of credit and new crops and technologies, and the arrival of traders and the panoply of the consumer economy are all, in their different ways, remoulding rural economy and society. This paper looks at one aspect of this multi-stranded process of agrarian transformation: the role and place of forests and, in particular, non-timber forest products, in rural people's lives and livelihoods. The paper highlights the contradictory and uneven livelihood-eroding/enhancing effects of these transformations. In many upland areas of Laos livelihoods are being squeezed from below by environmental degradation and from above by the operation of government policies and, more generally, by evolving market relations. While market pessimists see market integration as a largely destructive process, the paper highlights the opportunities that market integration can provide through diversification and livelihood reorientation. The challenge is that these opportunities are unequally available and are likely to promote social differentiation.

To address the social, economic, and ecological limitations of people-free parks and reserves, incentives have been incorporated into conservation programs in the hopes of making conservation meaningful to local people. However, such incentive-based programs have been implemented with little consideration for their ability to fulfill promises of greater protection of biodiversity. Evaluations of incentive-based conservation programs indicate that the approach continually falls short of the rhetoric. This article provides an overview of the problems associated with incentive-based conservation approaches in developing countries. It argues that existing incentive-based programs (IBPs) have yet to realize that benefits vary greatly at different “community” scales and that a holistic conceptualization of a community is essential to incorporate the complexities of a heterogeneous community when designing and implementing the IBPs. The spatial complexities involved in correctly identifying the beneficiaries in a community and the short-term focus of IBPs are two major challenges for sustaining conservation efforts.

The commercial collection of these products could reduce both the number of species and population of a species in the forests. In order to keep the balance between biodiversity and commercial collection of NTFPs, this paper evaluates the dependence of forest dwellers on NTFPs and identifies the relation between household characteristics and cash income generated by NTFP collection. As a result, commercial collection of NTFPs is negatively correlated to dependency ratio, poverty level and distance to the provincial city, and positively correlated with female labors of households. Moreover, NTFPs are proved to be very important in poor households or in those who lack rice or high rate of female labor. The households who have higher dependency ratio benefit less from NTFPs sold, while those who lack rice for their own consumption or have a higher rate of female labor depend more on NTFPs. Poor households are more dependent on NTFP collection than other groups. Finally, the result of this study highly recommends that the Government of Vietnam be aware of gender balance, distance to provincial city, poverty level and dependency ratio when applying a policy related to NTFP conservation. An appropriate incentive policy for woman and poor households might be a possible solution for less commercial collection of NTFPs. The poor households who have low dependency ratio or high female labor rate should be encouraged to participate in the forest management system to control the balance between commercial collection of NTFP and conservation.","|MA|","|142-035-704|",,"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.03.010","|",". quang d v anh t n commercial collection of ntfps and households living in or near the forests case study in que con cuong and ma tuong duong nghe an vietnam ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk in vietnam ntfps has become an important source of cash income for local people living in or near the forests the commercial collection of these products could reduce both the number of species and population of a species in the forests in order to keep the balance between biodiversity and commercial collection of ntfps this paper evaluates the dependence of forest dwellers on ntfps and identifies the relation between household characteristics and cash income generated by ntfp collection as a result commercial collection of ntfps is negatively correlated to dependency ratio poverty level and distance to the provincial city and positively correlated with female labors of households moreover ntfps are proved to be very important in poor households or in those who lack rice or high rate of female labor the households who have higher dependency ratio benefit less from ntfps sold while those who lack rice for their own consumption or have a higher rate of female labor depend more on ntfps poor households are more dependent on ntfp collection than other groups finally the result of this study highly recommends that the government of vietnam be aware of gender balance distance to provincial city poverty level and dependency ratio when applying a policy related to ntfp conservation an appropriate incentive policy for woman and poor households might be a possible solution for less commercial collection of ntfps the poor households who have low dependency ratio or high female labor rate should be encouraged to participate in the forest management system to control the balance between commercial collection of ntfp and conservation doi 10 1016 j ecolecon 2006 03 010 .",,

Such management varies in response to local economic and ecological conditions but invariably targets key nontimber forest resources destined for local markets, requires minimal input of labor and capital, and maintains a considerable stock of biotic resources.

It appears there is no shortage of options and opportunities for funding protected areas. A bigger challenge appears to be strengthening the capacity to manage them more effectively.

This is done through exploring a few case studies, chosen from a broad spectrum of African countries—Sudan, Malawi, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. The first case study examines the comparative returns to the gum arabic agroforestry system cultivated by poor farmers in Northern Sudan, and the role of policies in influencing these<BR>returns. The second explores how erratic agricultural pricing policies in Malawi during the 1980s may have distorted the incentives of poor smallholders to adopt le ss erosive crops in their farming systems. The third case study illustrates how inappropriate policies and investments can cause displacement of poorer rural groups from their traditional farming and grazing lands, by<BR>examining the loss of a major floodplain due to dam building in northern Nigeria. The final two case studies are concerned with policy lessons learned. The first looks at the impact of a macroeconomic adjustment policy—in this case trade liberalization—on farmer’s decisions to expand cultivated area rather than intensify crop production in western Ghana. The final case study<BR>examines the role of policy in land management success story in Africa, the Machakos district, Kenya, and explores the critical question of whether this success can be replicated elsewhere in Africa. These case studies serve two important functions. First, they demonstrate how policy analysis can be effective in highlighting key dimensions of the poverty-environment linkages<BR>underlying land degradation.

Vegetatively-propagated cultivars based on a sound knowledge of ‘ideotypes’ derived from an understanding of the tree-to-tree variation in many commercially important traits are being developed by farmers. These are being integrated into polycultural farming systems, especially the cocoa agroforests. Markets for Agroforestry Tree Products (AFTPs) are crucial for the adoption of agroforestry on a scale to have meaningful economic, social and environmental impacts. Important lessons have been learned in southern Africa from detailed studies of the commercialisation of AFTPs. These provide support for the wider acceptance of the role of domesticating indigenous trees in the promotion of enhanced livelihoods for poor farmers in the tropics. Policy guidelines have been developed in support of this sustainable rural development as an alternative strategy to those proposed in many other major development and conservation fora.","|Ag|","|","http://www.istf-bethesda.org/issues-articles/ijas%20119%20final.pdf",,"|",". leakey r r b tchoundjeu z schreckenberg k shackleton s e shackleton c m agroforestry tree products aftps targeting poverty reduction and enhanced livelihoods international journal of agricultural sustainability agroforestry tree domestication emerged as a farmer driven market led process in the early 1990s and became an international initiative a participatory approach now supplements the more traditional aspects of tree improvement and is seen as an important strategy towards the millennium development goals of eradicating poverty and hunger promoting social equity and environmental sustainability considerable progress has been made towards the domestication of indigenous fruits and nuts in many villages in cameroon and nigeria vegetatively propagated cultivars based on a sound knowledge of ‘ideotypes’ derived from an understanding of the tree to tree variation in many commercially important traits are being developed by farmers these are being integrated into polycultural farming systems especially the cocoa agroforests markets for agroforestry tree products aftps are crucial for the adoption of agroforestry on a scale to have meaningful economic social and environmental impacts important lessons have been learned in southern africa from detailed studies of the commercialisation of aftps these provide support for the wider acceptance of the role of domesticating indigenous trees in the promotion of enhanced livelihoods for poor farmers in the tropics policy guidelines have been developed in support of this sustainable rural development as an alternative strategy to those proposed in many other major development and conservation fora http www istf bethesda org issues articles ijas%20119%20final pdf .",,

Conservation investments often have long payback periods and reduce household incomes in the short-term. The critical question to small farmers is whether long-term conservation benefits would be sufficient to pay immediate investment costs, given all the constraints they face. This study uses biophysical data from two sites in the Ethiopian highlands to estimate the damage function from soil erosion and evaluate the profitability of conservation investments. Since farmers make ultimate land use decisions and lack incentives to account for externalities, a farm level cost benefit model is employed to study economic incentives to adopt proposed conservation<BR>technologies. Results indicate that economic benefits to farmers by switching to proposed land conservation practices are very low. Except the low cost technologies like grass strips, returns to conservation investments are too low especially when the rate of discount may be high. Thus, small farmers are unlikely to adopt high cost technologies unless a substantial subsidy is<BR>provided. However, subsidies are costly and often difficult to justify.

Environmental issues such as deforestation, pressure on water supplies, and pollution from industry and energy use pose real limits to further economic growth. In many Asian countries, the cost is equivalent to one third or more of Gross National Savings. They also exacerbate Asia’s high vulnerability to natural disasters. (Asia already suffers 90 per cent of all climate-related disasters, and this is likely to increase with climate change.) The challenge for governments and policymakers is to use natural wealth to generate growth and to enable the poor to benefit from this growth, while at the same time sustaining its capacity to produce these benefits into the future.

This paper examines the extent to which conservancies have been successful in meeting their primary goal of improving the lives of rural households. It evaluates the benefits of community conservancies in Namibia by asking three questions: (a) Do conservancies increase household welfare? (b) Are conservancies propoor?(c) And, do participants in conservancies gain more relative to those who choose not to participate? The analysis is based on a 2002 survey covering seven conservancies and 1,192 households. The results suggest that community conservancies have a positive impact on household welfare. This impact is poverty-neutral in some regions and pro-poor in others. Further, welfare benefits from conservancies appear to be some what evenly distributed between participant and non-participant households.","|CB|","|002-018-516|","http://wdsbeta.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2004/07/23/000112742_20040723114704/Rendered/PDF/wps3337.pdf",,"|O0145/DOU|",". bandyopadhyay s humavindu m n shyamsundar p wang w do households gain from community based natural resource management an evaluation of community conservancies in namibia policy research working papers world bank washington d c community based natural resource management is an important strategy to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and wildlife in namibia this paper examines the extent to which conservancies have been successful in meeting their primary goal of improving the lives of rural households it evaluates the benefits of community conservancies in namibia by asking three questions a do conservancies increase household welfare b are conservancies propoor c and do participants in conservancies gain more relative to those who choose not to participate the analysis is based on a 2002 survey covering seven conservancies and 1 192 households the results suggest that community conservancies have a positive impact on household welfare this impact is poverty neutral in some regions and pro poor in others further welfare benefits from conservancies appear to be some what evenly distributed between participant and non participant households http wdsbeta worldbank org external default wdscontentserver iw3p ib 2004 07 23 000112742_20040723114704 rendered pdf wps3337 pdf o0145 da .",,

The model has been used to assess the impact of improved access to non-farm income on household welfare, agricultural production, conservation investments and land degradation in form of soil erosion. The model simulations indicate that access to low-wage off-farm income is restricted by lack of employment opportunities since households otherwise would have engaged in more offfarm employment than observed. The simulations show that better (unconstrained) access to low-wage non-farm income has a substantial positive effect on household income. Total agricultural production (crop and livestock production) and farm inputs used are reduced when access to non-farm employment is improved and thus increases the need to import food to the area. Access to non-farm income reduces farm households’ incentives to invest in conservation and this leads to more overall soil erosion and more rapid land degradation even though intensity of production is reduced.

Although there are many studies that indicate village-level organisations have an impact in resource conservations, few have analysed the net benefits. This study is based on household data obtained from two forest reserves in Malawi. The results of the study are mixed, with forest co-management in one area showing a marginally increased forest revenue, and drastically reduced incomes in the other. However, the study does provide strong evidence that the forest devolution programme does raise revenue for female and low-income participants, although most benefits are ultimately gained by men and high-income groups due to discrimination and productivity differences. The devolution of forest management may therefore not be a panacea for addressing poverty and environmental problems in different socioeconomic settings. Forest co-management may indeed not be appropriate in areas where forests are necessary for daily livelihoods unless programmes are designed to provide other sources of income. However, seen in totality, the paper concludes that forest co-management can increase the contribution of forests to rural livelihood and poverty reduction.","|GP|CC|","|002-014-454|","http://le.uwpress.org/cgi/content/abstract/82/4/562",,"|",".  jumbe c b l angelsen a do the poor benefit from devolution policies evidence from malawi’s forest co management program department of economics and resource management norwegian university of life sciences this paper asks do local people and in particular vulnerable groups benefit from the devolution of forest management although there are many studies that indicate village level organisations have an impact in resource conservations few have analysed the net benefits this study is based on household data obtained from two forest reserves in malawi the results of the study are mixed with forest co management in one area showing a marginally increased forest revenue and drastically reduced incomes in the other however the study does provide strong evidence that the forest devolution programme does raise revenue for female and low income participants although most benefits are ultimately gained by men and high income groups due to discrimination and productivity differences the devolution of forest management may therefore not be a panacea for addressing poverty and environmental problems in different socioeconomic settings forest co management may indeed not be appropriate in areas where forests are necessary for daily livelihoods unless programmes are designed to provide other sources of income however seen in totality the paper concludes that forest co management can increase the contribution of forests to rural livelihood and poverty reduction http le uwpress org cgi content abstract 82 4 562  .",,

Authors find support for an inverse farm size-productivity relationship. They do not find support for the hypothesis that poverty causes land degradation, though there is evidence of a vicious circle of land degradation, with greater erosion on land that is viewed as of lower quality and fertility. These results imply that opportunities exist to address low agricultural productivity and land degradation in Uganda, though trade-offs are to be expected. The authors find that participation in technical assistance programs, pursuit of certain livelihood strategies, and investment in irrigation can achieve “win-win” outcomes, increasing agricultural productivity while reducing land degradation. Banana production is found to be more profitable than other crops. Despite these findings, there are several possible interventions likely to cause trade-offs between productivity and sustainability goals.

The levels of livestock predation by the snow leopard and other carnivores are high, and retaliatory killing by the herders is a direct threat to carnivore populations. Depletion of wild prey by poaching and competition from livestock also poses an indirect threat to the region's carnivores. Conservationists working in these underdeveloped areas that face serious economic damage from livestock losses have turned to incentive programs to motivate local communities to protect carnivores. We describe a pilot incentive program in India that aims to offset losses due to livestock predation and to enhance wild prey density by creating livestock-free areas on common land. We also describe how income generation from handicrafts in Mongolia is helping curtail poaching and retaliatory killing of snow leopards. However, initiatives to offset the costs of living with carnivores and to make conservation beneficial to affected people have thus far been small, isolated, and heavily subsidized.

In contrast to its neighbors, large areas of Myanmar's forest cover remain intact, providing a unique opportunity to conserve biodiversity within protected areas. High levels of deforestation, unrestricted hunting, and destructive agricultural practices have resulted in significant wildlife declines and rapid loss of natural habitats. We analyzed the status of 20 of the 31 officially gazetted protected areas in Myanmar within a framework that classified activities incompatible with protected-area status into two broad categories, small and large scale. Small-scale incompatibilities driven by economic necessity and lack of alternatives for local populations within and adjacent to protected areas occurred more frequently than large-scale incompatibilities driven by larger economic interests. Extraction of nontimber forest products was reported in 85% of the protected areas and ranked highest among the 15 identified incompatibilities. Grazing, hunting, fuelwood extraction, and permanent settlements occurred in more than 50% of the parks surveyed. Forty percent of the protected areas had some infrastructure for reserve management (with significant gaps) but insufficient on-site personnel to adequately perform management activities. Thirty-five percent had approximately half their staff trained in basic field techniques, and 60% had a planning document that was yet to be implemented. Older protected areas were affected by a greater number of incompatibilities than recently established protected areas. Major recommendations include the critical need to address the issue of hunting; involving local communities in the management of protected areas and buffer zones; building the technical capacity of protected-area staff; implementing a comprehensive land-use plan focused on stabilizing land use; and amending existing wildlife laws to fulfill international treaty obligations.","|PA|","|142-035-104|",,"10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00219.x","|O0102/CON|",". rao m rabinowitz a khaing s t status review of the protected area system in myanmar with recommendations for conservation planning conservation biology blackwell publishing myanmar is among the most biologically diverse countries in mainland southeast asia in contrast to its neighbors large areas of myanmar s forest cover remain intact providing a unique opportunity to conserve biodiversity within protected areas high levels of deforestation unrestricted hunting and destructive agricultural practices have resulted in significant wildlife declines and rapid loss of natural habitats we analyzed the status of 20 of the 31 officially gazetted protected areas in myanmar within a framework that classified activities incompatible with protected area status into two broad categories small and large scale small scale incompatibilities driven by economic necessity and lack of alternatives for local populations within and adjacent to protected areas occurred more frequently than large scale incompatibilities driven by larger economic interests extraction of nontimber forest products was reported in 85% of the protected areas and ranked highest among the 15 identified incompatibilities grazing hunting fuelwood extraction and permanent settlements occurred in more than 50% of the parks surveyed forty percent of the protected areas had some infrastructure for reserve management with significant gaps but insufficient on site personnel to adequately perform management activities thirty five percent had approximately half their staff trained in basic field techniques and 60% had a planning document that was yet to be implemented older protected areas were affected by a greater number of incompatibilities than recently established protected areas major recommendations include the critical need to address the issue of hunting; involving local communities in the management of protected areas and buffer zones; building the technical capacity of protected area staff; implementing a comprehensive land use plan focused on stabilizing land use; and amending existing wildlife laws to fulfill international treaty obligations doi 10 1046 j 1523 1739 2002 00219 x o0102 co .",,

This study examines the case of the tea industry in western Uganda, and uses a combination of fieldwork and remote sensing to pursue a more nuanced examination of the role of migration and non-monetary aspects of OFE on forest conservation in both a national park and unprotected forest contexts. Results indicate that the tea industry does serve as an off-farm employer to a limited number of local smallholders but these benefits are offset by the industry's overwhelming dependence on migrant labor which sees OFE as temporary, then seeks to settle locally. There is also evidence that the tea industry is contributing to conservation efforts of Kibale National Park by unintentionally serving as a physical buffer zone, which inhibits both human encroachment on the park and wildlife encroachment on smallholder crops. The latter represents a site-specific phenomenon that holds much potential for future management plans of the area and exemplifies the importance of considering the site-specific circumstances associated with OFE development.","|MA|","|002-014-800|",,,"|",". mulley b unruh j the role of off farm employment in tropical forest conservation labor migration and smallholder attitudes toward land in western uganda journal of environmental management elsevier science ltd uk the potential for off farm employment ofe to contribute significantly to forest conservation in the tropics is a widely held logic among donors governments and social scientists while an aggregate level examination of ofe cases can support this logic there is disagreement as to the operative aspects of specific linkages and assumptions this study examines the case of the tea industry in western uganda and uses a combination of fieldwork and remote sensing to pursue a more nuanced examination of the role of migration and non monetary aspects of ofe on forest conservation in both a national park and unprotected forest contexts results indicate that the tea industry does serve as an off farm employer to a limited number of local smallholders but these benefits are offset by the industry s overwhelming dependence on migrant labor which sees ofe as temporary then seeks to settle locally there is also evidence that the tea industry is contributing to conservation efforts of kibale national park by unintentionally serving as a physical buffer zone which inhibits both human encroachment on the park and wildlife encroachment on smallholder crops the latter represents a site specific phenomenon that holds much potential for future management plans of the area and exemplifies the importance of considering the site specific circumstances associated with ofe development .",,

These centralised protected area systems may have conserved biodiversity, but not without high social costs. Traditional forms of conservation were not recognised and, as people became increasingly alienated, their support for nature protection waned and conflicts escalated. With the post-1990 emphasis on decentralisation, equity and participation, community conservation began to develop, involving rural people in partnerships to preserve biodiversity and ensure livelihood security. This approach was also embraced to reduce the administrative and management costs of protected areas. Unfortunately, policy rhetoric has generally not been matched in practice. As a result, sceptical policy-makers and practitioners now question the viability of the concept itself – something which could lead to its abandonment. Given the pressures to decentralise government functions, there is little alternative except to continue experimenting with, adapting and institutionalising community conservation. Although community conservation is no panacea, the ground rules have changed for good: no park is an island – people and conservation can no longer be separated. Responsible authority needs to be devolved to ensure that benefits from conservation outweigh costs to communities, and that community conservation becomes firmly entrenched in national land-use and conservation strategies.","|PA|","|","http://www.naturebureau.co.uk/parks/parks_12_2.html#paperF",,"|",".  barrow e fabricius c do rural people really benefit from protected areas rhetoric or reality parks the creation of reserves in africa downgraded local people’s rights to land and resources with little compensation for losses incurred these centralised protected area systems may have conserved biodiversity but not without high social costs traditional forms of conservation were not recognised and as people became increasingly alienated their support for nature protection waned and conflicts escalated with the post 1990 emphasis on decentralisation equity and participation community conservation began to develop involving rural people in partnerships to preserve biodiversity and ensure livelihood security this approach was also embraced to reduce the administrative and management costs of protected areas unfortunately policy rhetoric has generally not been matched in practice as a result sceptical policy makers and practitioners now question the viability of the concept itself – something which could lead to its abandonment given the pressures to decentralise government functions there is little alternative except to continue experimenting with adapting and institutionalising community conservation although community conservation is no panacea the ground rules have changed for good no park is an island – people and conservation can no longer be separated responsible authority needs to be devolved to ensure that benefits from conservation outweigh costs to communities and that community conservation becomes firmly entrenched in national land use and conservation strategies http www naturebureau co uk parks parks_12_2 html#paperf  .",,

The study analyses the changes in this economic impact over recent years, as one area the Western Serengeti has experienced different approaches to settlement, land use and conservation management. Most recently, this management has encompassed the allocation of a certain proportion of wildlife revenues to community development activities in park-adjacent areas. However, these revenues alone, do not provide sufficient economic incentives for local communities to conserve wildlife. It is suggested, therefore, that more potential lies with the involvement of community members themselves as wildlife managers and entrepreneurs in collaboration with the private sector through a number of innovative arrangements and joint management.

In 2005, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA)offered compelling evidence of the positive links between biodiversity conservation and human well-being. In practice, however, biodiversity conservation and local people’s livelihoods often compete – particularly in some ‘top-down’ approaches to conservation such as certain national parks. Can ‘bottom-up’ approaches to conservation – decentralisation and community management – provide the answer? A recent review shows that community-led conservation can contribute to human well-being and to the achievement of many Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but in the majority of cases, it remains small-scale, isolated and not integrated within the formal conservation sector. We suggest that, given appropriate support, community conservation could achieve much more for poverty reduction. Indeed, without further local action, the international targets set within the CBD and the MDGs are likely to be unattainable.

Both are part of a major landscape-level conservation programme under implementation in Nepal, and both are under threat of political turmoil, uncontrolled immigration, inefficient land reform policies and unsustainable resource use. There was spatio-temporal variability in resource use patterns and dependence. People collected eight and seven types of resources in BNP and SWR, respectively, and people in BNP were more dependent on resources overall. About 72% of respondents mentioned the problem of inadequate firewood, and suggested the promotion of alternative energy and permission to collect from PAs as mitigating strategies.

The discussion focuses on the causes of poverty, its structural characteristics and the ways to face it. This article takes a brief historical perspective upon poverty. We will move from the time of colonization to the present time when, in the heart of the hegemonic power of neo-liberalism, we see a frantic search for ways to cope with almost 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty. Poverty eradication is one of the Millennium Development Goals, a commitment signed by the countries of The United Nations in 2000. Five years later, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment shows that much still has to be done to reconcile the problematic relation between environment and development. If the environmental problems will not be tackled in some systematic way, we will lose the benefits of ecological services. The fight against environmental degradation is thus a critical element to achieve the MDGs. The problems of poverty in Latin America are not related to lack of material or natural resources, or to lack of human productive capacities.

Unfortunately, many conservation initiatives take place at the expense of the poor and have negative impacts on the livelihoods of local communities. The understanding of the social consequences of conservation initiatives—  some of which may be rather subtle — needs to be improved and carefully documented. An action agenda focused on social justice and human rights would link conservation and sustainable natural resource management with the rights of local and indigenous communities and the most vulnerable groups of society. It would help them to maintain their livelihoods and cultural traditions. The fundamental principle is that conservation practices should at least do no harm. This does not detract from the main goal of nature conservation, but it does clarify that the goal of social justice is as important as protecting genes, species and habitats. This article recommends promoting respect for human rights as a premise for conservation; fostering social justice for the whole range of stakeholders involved in any given conservation initiative; developing mechanisms to articulate and reconcile conservation objectives and respect for human rights; and developing guidelines for the practice of social justice in conservation.","|PE|","|","http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/pm4_1.pdf",,"|",".  scherl l m social justice and human rights in conservation ethical considerations for policy and actions policy matters iucn gland conservation and natural resource management should not worsen the lives of communities unfortunately many conservation initiatives take place at the expense of the poor and have negative impacts on the livelihoods of local communities the understanding of the social consequences of conservation initiatives— some of which may be rather subtle — needs to be improved and carefully documented an action agenda focused on social justice and human rights would link conservation and sustainable natural resource management with the rights of local and indigenous communities and the most vulnerable groups of society it would help them to maintain their livelihoods and cultural traditions the fundamental principle is that conservation practices should at least do no harm this does not detract from the main goal of nature conservation but it does clarify that the goal of social justice is as important as protecting genes species and habitats this article recommends promoting respect for human rights as a premise for conservation; fostering social justice for the whole range of stakeholders involved in any given conservation initiative; developing mechanisms to articulate and reconcile conservation objectives and respect for human rights; and developing guidelines for the practice of social justice in conservation http cmsdata iucn org downloads pm4_1 pdf  .",,

An economy that has grown at 4-6% per year for eight years is placing increasing demands on natural resources, including the timber that is found in protected areas. While economic growth has provided some relief, poverty levels remain high, with 23 percent of the country consuming less than 1805 calories per day. Protected areas are surrounded by poor households, many of them landless, who rely for day-to-day survival on produce from the forest. Policy-makers in Bangladesh would have it that provision of money or in-kind transfers to these poor is the secret to successful conservation. But this assumption — that the poor are the cause of protected area loss and that poverty reduction is the solution — ignores two other significant demands being placed on protected areas. The more rapid loss of protected areas has been due to illegal commercial demands placed on forest products, especially timber and fuel for brick fields. In both cases these commercial demands are highly organized and sometimes politically supported. The protected area conservation challenge, then, is to organize resources in a way that allows the local poor to benefit from conservation and to empower those poor, and other local interests, to counter the vested power and infl uence behind illegal commercial use.

Based on ethnographic data of two villages adjacent to the Park, this paper describes the social differentiation within the local communities and shows their specific interactions with the Park’s resources. By identifying the costs of conservation and the benefits of Integrated Conservation and Development Programmes (ICDPs), such as the Park and People Programme (PPP) and Buffer Zone Management Programme (BZMP), as experienced by various social categories of people, this paper also examines distributional justice in the Park. It reveals that, contrary to the rhetoric, the participatory conservation interventions result in an unfair distribution of the costs and benefits in the Park and this has contributed to a widening of social inequalities among the local people. These are unintended consequences and the unequal relations of power and unfair distribution of costs and benefits are mutually reinforcing. This paper discusses how these distributional inequalities are utilised to garner “local support” for fortress conservation of the Park.

In the NBSAP planning strategy, the process of putting the plan together was as important as the final product. The process helped to increase awareness of biodiversity, empower people through participation and inspire some local initiatives to begin implementation of local plans. In this sense, the NBSAP process became a form of activism. It also demonstrated the potential of decentralised planning to generate positive spin-offs such as capacity building.

In recognition of the relationship between poverty and biodiversity loss, there is a global consensus that biodiversity conservation should also deliver poverty alleviation. In 1996 a conservation and development project was initiated at Ebok-Boje in the Cross River Forest region, home to the critically endangered Cross River Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli). The project introduced alternative livelihood opportunities as an incentive for local poor people to stop hunting.

This paradigm, which underpins Transboundary Protected Areas (TBPAs), holds that ecological integrity does and should transcend administrative and national boundaries. Yet such initiatives are in practice intrinsically political and raise important questions about power, accountability and legitimacy. This paper investigates the cultural politics of TBPAs, drawing out several ideological and practical tensions inherent in TBPA management at the global, regional and local scales. These include: the divergence between grassroots bioregionalism and top-down, technical ecoregionalism; trade-offs between conservation goals and attracting private sector investment and power asymmetries in public-private partnerships; the ceding of national sovereignty to supra- and sub-national entities; and tensions between the centralised and top-down nature of TBPA agreements and rhetoric on community participation and empowerment. Much experience to date suggests that many TBPAs are more likely to increase centralised state power and constrain livelihood strategies than to boost communities’ socioeconomic opportunities or role in management.

Depleting those resources or making them inaccessible can impoverish these people even further. ‘Pro-poor conservation’—that is, conservation that aims to support poor people—explicitly seeks to address basic human needs.

The roots of these different strands of the debate lie in much older discussions of the links between environment and development. There have been periods of convergence, especially around issues of sustainable development, participation and decentralization during the 1980s and 1990s. There have also been periods of divergence, in particular the disenchantment with community-based approaches to conservation and the prioritization of poverty over environment, during the 1990s and 2000s. Reactions to the outcomes of the 2003 World Parks Congress brought the three strands of the modern debate to a head. Ongoing discussions around these strands continue at a different pace but the debate appears to be moving fastest on biodiversity's place within the development agenda, although concerns over biodiversity remain marginal compared to the current focus on climate change.

Although it is clear that local and contingent variables have important effects on the social and economic impacts of protected area establishment, it is not known whether there is a general relationship between national wealth and the area, number and type of protected area designated. Here we conduct such an analysis. Our results suggest that wealthy countries have a larger number of protected areas of smaller size than poorer countries. However, we find few significant relationships between indicators of poverty and the extent of protected areas at a national scale. Our analysis therefore confirms that relationships between poverty and conservation action are dynamic and locally specific. This conclusion has implications for opposing positions within the debate on poverty and conservation. Critics of conservation who build upon local case studies to argue that protected areas make a significant contribution to poverty risk exaggerating the scale of the problem.

The paper tests the hypotheses that poverty rates in regions surrounding protected areas in developing countries are higher than national averages and that poverty rates are highest around large and strictly protected areas. Preliminary evidence suggests that infant mortality rates surrounding protected areas, and even those surrounding the most strictly protected areas, are not very different from national rates. Infant mortality rates are significantly higher among populations surrounding larger protected areas but the causal relationship is uncertain. Data limitations and other problems related to this kind of global analysis are discussed.

Prompted in part by their experience of the trade in Harpagophytum spp. the Parties to CITES, at the last two meetings of the Conference of the Parties, adopted decisions that accepted an obligation to take into account the impacts of CITES listings on the livelihoods of the poor and initiated a process to assist countries that wish to do this. These decisions, while respecting the primary focus of the CITES Convention on conservation, have some affinities with the ‘Do no harm’ approach to the livelihoods of the poor. The process will produce guidelines and rapid assessment tools. If these guidelines and tools are to be effective they will need to take account of the context-specific nature of solutions in this area. The CITES case provides lessons for other international conservation institutions whose activities affect the livelihoods of the poor at the local level.","|PE|","|",,"10.1017/S0030605307000786","|O0022/CON|",".  dickson b cites and the livelihoods of the poor oryx cambridge university press cambridge uk in the recent past many international conservation institutions including the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites have addressed the relationship between their work and poverty the empirical evidence suggests that while it is not the case that large numbers of the global poor are engaged in trading cites listed species in particular cases the trade in such species may be important to the livelihoods of the poor at the local level the approach of cites to poverty issues has evolved over time prompted in part by their experience of the trade in harpagophytum spp the parties to cites at the last two meetings of the conference of the parties adopted decisions that accepted an obligation to take into account the impacts of cites listings on the livelihoods of the poor and initiated a process to assist countries that wish to do this these decisions while respecting the primary focus of the cites convention on conservation have some affinities with the ‘do no harm’ approach to the livelihoods of the poor the process will produce guidelines and rapid assessment tools if these guidelines and tools are to be effective they will need to take account of the context specific nature of solutions in this area the cites case provides lessons for other international conservation institutions whose activities affect the livelihoods of the poor at the local level o0022 con  .",,

Variables such as migration status of the household, age, income class and landholdings were used to identify characteristics of households with high forest income in both absolute and relative terms. More than half of households reported receiving forest environmental income in cash. Socioeconomic variables were compared between forest cash income (FCI) households and non-FCI households. Non-FCI households had more alternative income sources from wage labour and livestock, while FCI households were significantly younger, tended to live closer to the forest and had larger landholdings. Contrary to other research on forest use, the households deriving the most forest income in both absolute and relative terms were not the poorer households, but those in the middle class.

The Kyoto Protocol, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, includes a Clean Development Mechanism to provide for payments for certain forms of carbon sequestration that may benefit animal species (at least as an incidental benefit). Other market-based approaches for paying for carbon sequestration services outside the Kyoto framework are being promoted in various parts of the world. Another common form of payment for ecosystem services is compensating upstream landowners for managing their land in ways that maintain downstream water quality; this can include habitat management that benefits wild animal species. While biodiversity itself is difficult to value, it can be linked to other markets, such as certification in the case of sustainably-produced forest products. This paper expands on some of the markets for ecosystem services that also benefit wildlife, identifies relevant sources of information, and highlights some of the initiatives linking such markets to poverty alleviation. Making markets work for ecosystem services requires an appropriate policy framework, government support, operational institutional support, and innovation at scales from the site level to the national level.

They explicitly recognize the need to address difficult trade-offs by bridging the interests of landowners and external actors through compensations. Theoretical assessments praise the advantages of PES over indirect approaches, but in the tropics PES application has remained incipient. Here I aim to demystify PES and clarify its scope for application as a tool for tropical conservation. I focus on the supply side of PES (i.e., how to convert PES funding into effective conservation on the ground), which until now has been widely neglected. I reviewed the PES literature for developing countries and combined these findings with observations from my own field studies in Latin America and Asia. A PES scheme, simply stated, is a voluntary, conditional agreement between at least one \"seller\" and one \"buyer\" over a well-defined environmental service—or a land use presumed to produce that service. Major obstacles to effective PES include demand-side limitations and a lack of supply-side know-how regarding implementation. The design of PES programs can be improved by explicitly outlining baselines, calculating conservation opportunity costs, customizing payment modalities, and targeting agents with credible land claims and threats to conservation. Expansion of PES can occur if schemes can demonstrate clear additionality (i.e., incremental conservation effects vis-à-vis predefined baselines), if PES recipients' livelihood dynamics are better understood, and if efficiency goals are balanced with considerations of fairness. PES are arguably best suited to scenarios of moderate conservation opportunity costs on marginal lands and in settings with emerging, not-yet realized threats. Actors who represent credible threats to the environment will more likely receive PES than those already living in harmony with nature. A PES scheme can thus benefit both buyers and sellers while improving the resource base, but it is unlikely to fully replace other conservation instruments.","|MA|","|","http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118487644/abstract","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00559.x","|O0014/EDI|",".  wunder s the efficiency of payments for environmental services in tropical conservation conservation biology payments for environmental services pes represent a new more direct way to promote conservation they explicitly recognize the need to address difficult trade offs by bridging the interests of landowners and external actors through compensations theoretical assessments praise the advantages of pes over indirect approaches but in the tropics pes application has remained incipient here i aim to demystify pes and clarify its scope for application as a tool for tropical conservation i focus on the supply side of pes i e how to convert pes funding into effective conservation on the ground which until now has been widely neglected i reviewed the pes literature for developing countries and combined these findings with observations from my own field studies in latin america and asia a pes scheme simply stated is a voluntary conditional agreement between at least one seller and one buyer over a well defined environmental service—or a land use presumed to produce that service major obstacles to effective pes include demand side limitations and a lack of supply side know how regarding implementation the design of pes programs can be improved by explicitly outlining baselines calculating conservation opportunity costs customizing payment modalities and targeting agents with credible land claims and threats to conservation expansion of pes can occur if schemes can demonstrate clear additionality i e incremental conservation effects vis à vis predefined baselines if pes recipients livelihood dynamics are better understood and if efficiency goals are balanced with considerations of fairness pes are arguably best suited to scenarios of moderate conservation opportunity costs on marginal lands and in settings with emerging not yet realized threats actors who represent credible threats to the environment will more likely receive pes than those already living in harmony with nature a pes scheme can thus benefit both buyers and sellers while improving the resource base but it is unlikely to fully replace other conservation instruments http www3 interscience wiley com journal 118487644 abstract o0014 edi  .",,

The research frameworks suggested by Adaptive Management (AM), social learning, and complex adaptive systems (resilience thinking) are considered. While AM typically emphasizes natural science and ecological systems, and social learning emphasizes human agency and interaction, resilience thinking addresses social-ecological systems as complex entities that behave in dynamic and cyclical fashion. All three frameworks offer insights into practices that support learning, adaptation, and sustainability. Some of the experience in the Canadian province of British Columbia is given in example. The emerging framework of adaptive co-management offers a promising approach to capturing relevant features of the other three. These four different conceptual approaches should not be seen as mutually exclusive alternatives but rather are characterized by overlapping features with different focal strengths. To date, experience with applying any of these frameworks in practice is limited and remains a big challenge.

Community-based natural resources management (CBNRM) in the miombo ecoregion of east and southern Africa has addressed these issues in its evolution. This has seen the evolution of policy, legal and institutional mechanisms that attach market value to commonly controlled resources and facilitate market-led conservation, leading to some successful sustainable management of natural resources. The lessons from CBNRM in the miombo ecoregion provide a basis on which REDD+ in dry-land forests can build. While there has been a general positive trend in the development of supportive policies at regional level, individual countries are at different stages of a policy continuum. In a region where poverty is high and is also a key driver of land use change, REDD+ mechanisms need to be pro-poor, explicitly addressing and building the assets and capability of the poorest households at policy level and in practice. They also need to pay for the value of land uses that the poor could have otherwise pursued in the absence of REDD+ as well as the costs of facilitating the implementation of REDD+ in environments where forest resources are often jointly owned or managed by communities. These costs are highly variable across the region.<BR>The Program on Forests (PROFOR) supported a research project in the miombo ecoregion to address these and other issues that a REDD program in the region would be confronted with.

From 2000-2002, Professor Virgilio Viana worked with IIED to explore options for more forest-friendly forms of development. The Governor of Amazonas subsequently appointed Viana as the first ever Secretary for Environment and Sustainable Development. Viana was able to make the case for and implement several options, which were marked out by being scientifically based, simple to understand, and attractive to many stakeholders.

This project’s success has huge implications for reducing deforestation, cutting emissions and eradicating poverty, and its time has definitely come. Between 1990 and 2005, over a million square kilometres of forest were lost in the tropics. Half that was in the Amazon. Deforestation accounts for over 17 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, so a curb on felling is key to successfully mitigating climate change.

Andean Communities and International Fibre Markets","JA","International Journal of the Commons",,,,"Vol 4 No 1","pp. 100–121","Igitur, Utrecht Publishing & Archiving Services for IASC","Vicuna (Vicugna vicugna) fibre is produced by extremely low-income communities that inhabit the harsh environment of the Andes in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia. At the other end of the social scale, affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices for vicuna-made accessories and clothes. Vicuna management projects follow the logic of community-based wildlife management. The rationale for seeking to conserve vicuñas through sustainable use is that commercial utilization of the fibre (obtained from live-shorn animals) will generate sufficient economic benefits to outweigh the costs of conservation, and contribute to community development and poverty alleviation. However, although conservation efforts have been extremely successful with vicuñas having recovered from the brink of extinction, the socio-economic achievements have thus far proved modest. This paper explores multiple-objective projects that address vicuña conservation and poverty alleviation in Andean countries. In doing so, it analyses the tensions that exist between these objectives, as well as the factors that limit a more equitable distribution of benefits among stakeholders. Examples are drawn from vicuna management under common-property in Peru and Bolivia, and vicuna captive management under private property in Argentina. These case studies enable us to illustrate the complex relationship between local communities and the global market, and the importance of community enterprises and supportive government policy in managing a common pool resource.","|CS|","|019-005-032|019-005-152|019-005-604|019-005-068|","http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/lichtenstein_ijc.pdf",,"|",".  lichtenstein g vicuña conservation and poverty alleviation andean communities and international fibre markets international journal of the commons igitur utrecht publishing & archiving services for iasc vicuna vicugna vicugna fibre is produced by extremely low income communities that inhabit the harsh environment of the andes in argentina chile peru and bolivia at the other end of the social scale affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices for vicuna made accessories and clothes vicuna management projects follow the logic of community based wildlife management the rationale for seeking to conserve vicuñas through sustainable use is that commercial utilization of the fibre obtained from live shorn animals will generate sufficient economic benefits to outweigh the costs of conservation and contribute to community development and poverty alleviation however although conservation efforts have been extremely successful with vicuñas having recovered from the brink of extinction the socio economic achievements have thus far proved modest this paper explores multiple objective projects that address vicuña conservation and poverty alleviation in andean countries in doing so it analyses the tensions that exist between these objectives as well as the factors that limit a more equitable distribution of benefits among stakeholders examples are drawn from vicuna management under common property in peru and bolivia and vicuna captive management under private property in argentina these case studies enable us to illustrate the complex relationship between local communities and the global market and the importance of community enterprises and supportive government policy in managing a common pool resource http www camelidosgecs com ar pdf lichtenstein_ijc pdf  .",,

Vicuna management in Peru was chosen as a case study because of the moves to give Andean communities more rights over these wild animals and the Government initiatives to promote sustainable use. The study examines how CWM has worked out in practice. It considers whether communities have benefited and whether conservation of the vicuna has been improved. It also analyses the factors that influence the outcome, in particular the move to promote captive management. The findings suggest that community-based vicuna management could potentially have a significant social impact and be a means for promoting development at the local level. However, this potential is not being realised. Lack of significant benefits for community members translates into limited social impact and lack of interest. More important, the transfer of rights to communities has not been accompanied by institutional development and capacity building so that communities can play an effective role in management.

The review finds positive experiences with community enterprises, including farm-based cottage industries supplying local markets and community tourism ventures that provide useful examples of job creation and income generation. Securing sustainable local benefits from livelihood ‘alternatives’ proposed under new national climate protection and forest conservation schemes will require legal and policy measures (still lacking in June 2010) up-front to recognise and respect indigenous peoples’ land and resource rights, protect traditional livelihood practices coupled with robust frameworks for free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), good faith negotiation and local benefit sharing. The study concludes that there is no single economic solution for creating sustainable jobs and income in indigenous areas: the most likely viable option for Amerindian communities is to develop a diverse set of enterprise activities based on farming, tourism, crafts and community-based natural resource management.

Among the numerous approaches undertaken to stop or lessen this process, access and benefit-sharing (ABS), a market-based approach, has emerged as among the most prominent. In theory, ABS turns biodiversity and genetic resources from an open access good to a private good and creates a market for genetic resources. It internalizes the resources’ positive externalities by pricing the commercial values for research and development and makes users pay for it. Users’ benefits are shared with the resource holders and set incentives for the sustainable use and the conservation of biodiversity. Carmen Richerzhagen, however, finds that in practice there are significant questions about the effectiveness of the approach in the protection of biodiversity and about the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the commercialization.

By improving informed governance, it is possible to stabilize biodiversity levels and provide a basis for poor local people to collaborate, and to improve their situation in the face of threats from development. In this study we analyze the ongoing processes being applied in two Gran Chaco cases - from the Upper Parapeti Basin (upriver from Kaa Iya National Park) in Bolivia, and the Lower Pilcomayo in northern Argentina (a dynamic internal delta ecosystem where a tri-national biosphere reserve is being considered). Watershed management, when adapted to local ecological, cultural, social and political contexts, is shown to be an effective tactical strategy to activate moribund governmental institutions in response to local constituencies. In the two cases presented, NGO-facilitated processes enriched local people´s ability to take their own actions and to assess and frame their problems and goals for dialogue with their governments. The NGOs also offered technical assistance with land-use zoning, reforestation and alternative income-generation activities in collaborations that shifted government engagement.

Following MPA establishment, food security generally remained stable or increased in older and smaller MPAs. The ability of most fishing groups to govern MPA resources changed. Increased resource rights were positively correlated with MPA zoning and compliance with MPA regulations. Small sample sizes precluded statistical tests of the impacts of MPAs on employment, community organization, and income. Our results demonstrate that MPAs shape the social well-being and political power of fishing communities; impacts (positive and negative) vary within and among social groups; and social impacts are correlated with some—but not all—commonly hypothesized explanatory factors.

Proximate causes of PADDD vary widely, but center on access to and use of natural resources. Case studies from India and South America highlight the fact that PAs are socially defined and socially constructed governance regimes, responsive to social pressures—including conservation demands—at local to global scales. PADDD challenges longstanding assumptions underlying conservation policy and practice, including efforts to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), and underscores the need for resilient and robust conservation strategies.

Vicuña fibre is produced by extremely low income communities that inhabit the harsh environment of the high Andes in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia. At the other end of the world, affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices for apparel made of vicuña fibre. Vicuña management projects follow the logic of community-based wildlife management. The rationale for vicuña conservation through sustainable use is that commercial utilization of fibre obtained from live-shorn individuals will generate sufficient economic benefits to outweigh the costs of conservation, and contribute to community development and poverty alleviation. However, while conservation efforts have been extremely successful with vicuñas having recovered from the brink of extinction, the socio-economic achievements have thus far proved modest. Most such benefits are being captured by traders and international textile companies, rather than by local communities.

Social impacts of payments for environmental services in Costa Rica","Rp",,,,,,"32 pp.","IIED, London","Costa Rica’s pioneering programme of payments for environmental services (PES) which began in the 1990s was a unique experiment in developing countries at that time. Under the PES programme, economic recognition of forests moved from a ‘timber-only’ approach to a wider concept of ecosystem services that feeds directly into human and industrial functions of production or consumption. Farmers who owned forests could receive payments for the benefits their forests produced, and people who benefited from those services were expected to pay for them. But who really benefits and loses from these programmes? A clearer understanding of distributional issues in PES-type projects is becoming increasingly important for the design of large scale projects such as REDD+, in Costa Rica and elsewhere. This study looks in detail at the social impacts of the programme, and addresses issues related to equity and poverty on the basis of long-term data from all the PES contracts signed. Results show that the payments tend to go to areas with lower opportunity costs, relatively large farms and private companies and suggest that more needs to be done for PES to have genuine social and economic benefits for the poor. The report concludes by recommending steps that could be taken to help make this happen.","|MA|","|019-013-188|","http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/15518IIED.pdf?",,"|",".  porras i fair and green social impacts of payments for environmental services in costa rica iied london costa rica’s pioneering programme of payments for environmental services pes which began in the 1990s was a unique experiment in developing countries at that time under the pes programme economic recognition of forests moved from a ‘timber only’ approach to a wider concept of ecosystem services that feeds directly into human and industrial functions of production or consumption farmers who owned forests could receive payments for the benefits their forests produced and people who benefited from those services were expected to pay for them but who really benefits and loses from these programmes a clearer understanding of distributional issues in pes type projects is becoming increasingly important for the design of large scale projects such as redd in costa rica and elsewhere this study looks in detail at the social impacts of the programme and addresses issues related to equity and poverty on the basis of long term data from all the pes contracts signed results show that the payments tend to go to areas with lower opportunity costs relatively large farms and private companies and suggest that more needs to be done for pes to have genuine social and economic benefits for the poor the report concludes by recommending steps that could be taken to help make this happen http pubs iied org pdfs 15518iied pdf  .",,

Protected areas can act as a case study for REDD: lessons can be learnt from their success or otherwise in reducing deforestation and supporting local livelihoods. Depending upon the exact mechanisms decided between and within countries, protected areas could have a role to play in reducing national-scale deforestation, through strengthening existing forest protected areas and/or declaring new areas. Overall, protected areas are effective at limiting deforestation, but there are exceptions. Their track record in supporting livelihoods is more variable. The early indications are that community-managed and indigenous reserves are often effective in achieving both goals, but that biodiversity conservation is not necessarily such a high priority within these areas.

Conservation enterprises—commercial activities generating economic and social benefits in ways that help meet conservation objectives—seek to reinforce these incentives. The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) has adopted conservation enterprise as a core part of its conservation strategy since the 1990s. It predominantly supports partnerships between local communities and the private sector, with the community retaining ownership and the private sector providing the management expertise and paying a combination of fixed and variable fees to the community for access to its resources. This study draws on the experience of the AWF and other organisations to assess what effect conservation enterprises can have on the livelihoods of local communities and how effective such initiatives are at poverty reduction. It finds that most of these enterprises cannot by themselves take people out of poverty, but can provide less tangible benefits, such as increased investment in health and education, strengthened community organisations and greater resilience in difficult times. A successful conservation enterprise needs to strike a balance between harnessing local skills and entrepreneurship and ensuring that the benefits are felt by the entire local community, particularly those who make the decisions about resource use. Some programmes can be specifically targeted at particular groups, but enterprises providing employment tend not to favour the poorest community members and the benefits may be captured by local elites. The evidence also shows that well-designed conservation enterprises can improve the conservation of some types of land areas and key, high value species—such as mountain gorillas—but are less effective at conserving biodiversity with a lower market value.","|MA|","|","http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/14613IIED.pdf?",,"|",".  elliott j sumba d conservation enterprise what works where and for whom iied london community based natural resource management cbnrm recognises that local communities are often best placed to conserve natural resources as long as they stand to gain more than they lose from doing so conservation enterprises—commercial activities generating economic and social benefits in ways that help meet conservation objectives—seek to reinforce these incentives the african wildlife foundation awf has adopted conservation enterprise as a core part of its conservation strategy since the 1990s it predominantly supports partnerships between local communities and the private sector with the community retaining ownership and the private sector providing the management expertise and paying a combination of fixed and variable fees to the community for access to its resources this study draws on the experience of the awf and other organisations to assess what effect conservation enterprises can have on the livelihoods of local communities and how effective such initiatives are at poverty reduction it finds that most of these enterprises cannot by themselves take people out of poverty but can provide less tangible benefits such as increased investment in health and education strengthened community organisations and greater resilience in difficult times a successful conservation enterprise needs to strike a balance between harnessing local skills and entrepreneurship and ensuring that the benefits are felt by the entire local community particularly those who make the decisions about resource use some programmes can be specifically targeted at particular groups but enterprises providing employment tend not to favour the poorest community members and the benefits may be captured by local elites the evidence also shows that well designed conservation enterprises can improve the conservation of some types of land areas and key high value species—such as mountain gorillas—but are less effective at conserving biodiversity with a lower market value http pubs iied org pdfs 14613iied pdf  .",,

At the same time, targets to reduce human poverty worldwide are also off track. This dual challenge has led to a search for effective mechanisms and entry points through which conservation and development objectives can be addressed together. Both conservation and development sectors, within their own sphere of interest, have advocated the importance of local participation and also of partnership between conservation agencies and local people. This paper discusses why working with local organisations can be an important entry point for conservation and poverty reduction, describes the global experience of BirdLife International in this context, and concludes with a discussion, based on BirdLife’s experience, of some of the issues and constraints which need to be taken into account when addressing conservation and poverty reduction through working with local organisations. Three examples, one from South America (Bolivia) one from Africa (Uganda) and one from Asia (Nepal), help to illustrate how BirdLife’s partners have worked with local organisations as an entry point to achieving conservation and poverty reduction. These examples, and BirdLife International’s very rich experience in this approach worldwide, reveal that working in partnership with local organisations ensures that environment and poverty are addressed in a more holistic way, as experienced and understood by local people. It also has benefits in terms of sustainability, efficiency, legitimacy and respect for rights. However, it needs to be part of a broader strategy, particularly one which addresses drivers and root causes of poverty and biodiversity loss at larger scales. Linking local organisations to national and international networks can help to ensure that local voices are heard in such forums.","|PE|","|","http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/14614IIED.pdf?",,"|",".  david thomas poverty biodiversity and local organisations lessons from birdlife international iied london global targets to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss significantly by 2010 have not been met and the rate of biodiversity loss does not appear to be slowing at the same time targets to reduce human poverty worldwide are also off track this dual challenge has led to a search for effective mechanisms and entry points through which conservation and development objectives can be addressed together both conservation and development sectors within their own sphere of interest have advocated the importance of local participation and also of partnership between conservation agencies and local people this paper discusses why working with local organisations can be an important entry point for conservation and poverty reduction describes the global experience of birdlife international in this context and concludes with a discussion based on birdlife’s experience of some of the issues and constraints which need to be taken into account when addressing conservation and poverty reduction through working with local organisations three examples one from south america bolivia one from africa uganda and one from asia nepal help to illustrate how birdlife’s partners have worked with local organisations as an entry point to achieving conservation and poverty reduction these examples and birdlife international’s very rich experience in this approach worldwide reveal that working in partnership with local organisations ensures that environment and poverty are addressed in a more holistic way as experienced and understood by local people it also has benefits in terms of sustainability efficiency legitimacy and respect for rights however it needs to be part of a broader strategy particularly one which addresses drivers and root causes of poverty and biodiversity loss at larger scales linking local organisations to national and international networks can help to ensure that local voices are heard in such forums http pubs iied org pdfs 14614iied pdf  .",,

Balanced assessments are rare, however, particularly in West Africa. This paper examines the first 10 years of Ghana's Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary using an evaluation framework that considers socioeconomic and ecological outcomes, as well as resilience mechanisms. Building upon traditional taboos against the killing of hippopotami, this initiative has attempted to conserve an imperilled large mammal, protect biodiversity and alleviate abject poverty amidst a bush meat crisis and complex ethnic diversity. Findings show that the Sanctuary has improved local livelihoods by spurring economic diversification and infrastructure development rates 2-8 times higher than in surrounding communities. Simultaneously, threats to biodiversity have subsided, hippopotamus numbers have remained stable and the Sanctuary's riparian habitats now harbour more bird species than comparable areas nearby. Improved social capital, true empowerment, an equitable distribution of benefits, ecological awareness among children and support for the Sanctuary, even amongst community members who were disadvantaged by its creation, speak to good long-term prospects. Risks remain, some of which are beyond the community's control, but evidence of socioecological resilience suggests that capacity exists to buffer risks and foster sustainability.

Failure to link ecological processes and their societal benefits has favored highly destructive aquaculture and tourism developments that threaten mangroves and result in costly “externalities.” Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove–water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US $37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, falling within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is >300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government.

Because these protected areas are often placed in regions with widespread poverty and because they can limit agricultural development and exploitation of natural resources, concerns have been raised about their potential to create or reinforce poverty traps. Previous studies suggest that the protected area systems in Costa Rica and Thailand, on average, reduced deforestation and alleviated poverty. We examine these results in more detail by characterizing the heterogeneity of responses to protection conditional on observable characteristics. We find no evidence that protected areas trap historically poorer areas in poverty. In fact, we find that poorer areas at baseline seem to have the greatest levels of poverty reduction as a result of protection. However, we do find that the spatial characteristics associated with the most poverty alleviation are not necessarily the characteristics associated with the most avoided deforestation.

Over this decade, KNP generally maintained forest cover, tree species, and primate populations, whereas neighboring communal forest patches were reduced by half and showed substantial declines in tree species and primate populations. However, a bad decade for forest outside the park proved a prosperous one for most local residents. Panel data for 252 households show substantial improvement in welfare indicators (e.g., safer water, more durable roof material), with the greatest increases found among those with highest initial assets. A combination of regression analysis and matching estimators shows that although the poor tend to be located on the park perimeter, proximity to the park has no measureable effect on growth of productive assets. The risk for land loss among the poor was inversely correlated with proximity to the park, initial farm size, and decline in adjacent communal forests. We conclude the current disproportionate presence of poor households at the edge of the park does not signal that the park is a poverty trap.

We examine the dynamic links in shifting cultivation systems among asset poverty, land use, and land cover in a community where poverty is persistent and primary forests have been replaced over time—with community enclosure—by secondary forests (i.e., fallows), orchards, and crop land. Land cover change is assessed using aerial photographs/satellite imagery from 1965 to 2007. Household and plot level data are used to track land holding, portfolios, and use as well as land cover over the past 30 y, with particular attention to forest status (type and age). Our analyses find evidence for two important types of “land-use” poverty traps—a “subsistence crop” trap and a “short fallow” trap—and indicate that the initial conditions of land holding by forest peasants have long-term effects on future forest cover and household welfare.

We demonstrate the effect in the context of Saadani National Park (SANAPA) in Tanzania, where enforcement of prohibition of mangrove harvesting was strengthened to preserve biodiversity. Remote sensing data of mangrove cover over time are integrated with georeferenced household survey data in an econometric framework to identify the causal effect of mangrove protection on income components directly linked to mangrove ecosystem services. Our findings suggest that many households experienced an immediate loss in the consumption of mangrove firewood, with the loss most prevalent in richer households. However, all wealth classes appear to benefit from long-term sustainability gains in shrimping and fishing that result from mangrove protection. On average, we find that a 10% increase in the mangrove cover within SANAPA boundaries in a 5-km2 radius of the subvillage increases shrimping income by approximately twofold.

Both household coping strategies and larger-scale economic development efforts have caused severe natural resource degradation that limits future economic opportunities and endangers ecosystem services. A model based on a business infrastructure has been developed to promote and maintain sustainable agricultural and natural resource management practices, leading to direct and indirect conservation outcomes. The Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO) model operates primarily with communities surrounding national parks, strengthening conservation benefits produced by these protected areas. COMACO first identifies the least food-secure households and trains them in sustainable agricultural practices that minimize threats to natural resources while meeting household needs. In addition, COMACO identifies people responsible for severe natural resource depletion and trains them to generate alternative income sources. In an effort to maintain compliance with these practices, COMACO provides extension support and access to high-value markets that would otherwise be inaccessible to participants. Because the model is continually evolving via adaptive management, success or failure of the model as a whole is difficult to quantify at this early stage. We therefore test specific hypotheses and present data documenting the stabilization of previously declining wildlife populations; the meeting of thresholds of productivity that give COMACO access to stable, high-value markets and progress toward economic self-sufficiency; and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices by participants and other community members.

This paper tests some of these win–win claims. Analysis of a panel of detailed household data suggests that the boom has enabled some rural households to increase consumption, increase their goat herds (which bodes poorly for the argan forest), and send their girls to secondary school. The boom has predictably made households vigilant guardians of fruit on the tree, but it has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health. We evaluate landscape-level impacts of these changes using commune-level data on educational enrollment and normalized difference vegetation index data over the period from 1981 to 2009. The results of the mesoanalysis of enrollment are consistent with the microanalysis: the argan boom seems to have improved educational outcomes, especially for girls.

It is not surprising therefore that a large number of programmatic interventions have aimed to achieve the two goals at the same time. These interventions are funded by governments, conservation NGOs, bilateral and multilateral donor agencies, and private sector organizations. In this paper, we first examine the conceptual discussion around poverty and biodiversity, and then analyze three such interventions: community-based wildlife management, extractive reserves, and ecotourism. Our discussion shows that the literature on these programmatic interventions depends on relatively simplified understandings of poverty and biodiversity in stark contrast to the theoretical literature on the two concepts. Further, writings on programmatic interventions tend to operationalize poverty and biodiversity in distinct and quite different ways. Our analysis focuses on peer-reviewed writings and finds that 34 of the 37 identified studies share two common features: a focus on processes and outcomes in a single case and single time period, and a drastic simplification of the complex concepts of poverty and biodiversity. In addition, the cases we examine are relatively inattentive to the relationships between observed outcomes and the contextual features of programmatic interventions. As a result of these shared features, the mass of scholarly work on the subject does not permit systematic and context-sensitive generalizations about the conditions under which it may be possible to achieve poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation simultaneously. The vast sums channeled toward joint achievement of poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation are all the more remarkable in light of the basic lack of evidence on the extent to which these goals can jointly be reached.

Rural Households are confronted with various covariate and idiosyncratic shocks and are often severely constrained in coping with such events. They frequently resort to food from natural resources such as indigenous fruits during times of crisis. The availability of such food sources is increasingly at risk due to deforestation and biodiversity loss. The objective of this paper is to quantify the contribution of indigenous fruit trees towards reducing vulnerability to food insecurity and poverty. The methodology used is a multi-period stochastic household income model. The data were collected in a case study in Zimbabwe using detailed monthly income and expenditure records of a sample of 39 rural households in two areas. The two regions differ in their agricultural system. In one area horticulture, off-farm activities and exotic fruits are a major source of income while in the other area indigenous fruits are a more important source of income. This paper concentrates on the latter area. Model calculations show that rural households in Zimbabwe are highly vulnerable to seasonal fluctuations in income and therefore a critical period where households run high risk of being food insecure can be identified. While indigenous fruits, as a low cost natural resource, can facilitate income smoothing, the role of other sources of income must not be neglected. The paper concludes that diversified season-specific income generating portfolios must be designed of which indigenous fruit trees have a role to play.","|Ag|PE|CS|","|002-014-716|","http://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/gdec06/4751.html#provider",,"|",".  akinnifesi f waibel h mithöfer d the role of food from natural resources in reducing vulnerability to poverty a case study from zimbabwe verein für socialpolitik research committee development economics verein für socialpolitik research committee development economics vulnerability to poverty is a major problem in the rural areas of sub saharan africa rural households are confronted with various covariate and idiosyncratic shocks and are often severely constrained in coping with such events they frequently resort to food from natural resources such as indigenous fruits during times of crisis the availability of such food sources is increasingly at risk due to deforestation and biodiversity loss the objective of this paper is to quantify the contribution of indigenous fruit trees towards reducing vulnerability to food insecurity and poverty the methodology used is a multi period stochastic household income model the data were collected in a case study in zimbabwe using detailed monthly income and expenditure records of a sample of 39 rural households in two areas the two regions differ in their agricultural system in one area horticulture off farm activities and exotic fruits are a major source of income while in the other area indigenous fruits are a more important source of income this paper concentrates on the latter area model calculations show that rural households in zimbabwe are highly vulnerable to seasonal fluctuations in income and therefore a critical period where households run high risk of being food insecure can be identified while indigenous fruits as a low cost natural resource can facilitate income smoothing the role of other sources of income must not be neglected the paper concludes that diversified season specific income generating portfolios must be designed of which indigenous fruit trees have a role to play http ideas repec org p zbw gdec06 4751 html#provider  .",,

In agroecosystems, biodiversity performs a variety of ecological services beyond the production of food, including recycling of nutrients, regulation of microclimate and local hydrological processes, suppression of undesirable organisms and detoxification of noxious chemicals.

In the face of a potential worldwide pollination crisis it is important to assess which countries may be more vulnerable in order to prioritize pollinator conservation efforts. The poverty level, the population density and the level of pollinator dependence for food provisioning are key aspects to identify vulnerable countries. We evaluate these aspects and determine the level of human food provisioning dependence on pollinators in Mexico, a developing and highly populated country. The diversity of crop species in Mexico is exceptionally high. Nearly 85% of fruit and/or seed consumed species depend to some degree on pollinators for productivity. Overall, pollinator-dependent crops generate larger income but cover a lower cultivated area and produce less volume compared to non-pollinator-dependent crops. Volume per unit area, however, as well as revenue per unit area, is much higher for pollinator-dependent crops. Native wild pollinators also play a key role in fruit or seed production of Mexican domesticated plant species and in the reproduction of many useful wild species. Thus, assuring free pollination services is particularly important in Mexico as the livelihood of a large proportion of the population exclusively and directly depends on ecosystem services for subsistence. Feasible conservation strategies involve the payment of environmental services to Ejidos (communal land tenure systems) making efforts to protect or restore plant resources and native pollinators, and the creation of new protected natural areas, which ensures food provision, mating and nesting sites for pollinators.","|CG|","|019-013-484|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709000512","doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2009.01.016","|",".  ashworth l quesada m biodiversity and poverty reduction the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem services biological conservation elsevier science ltd uk animal pollination is one of the essential services provided by ecosystems to humans in the face of a potential worldwide pollination crisis it is important to assess which countries may be more vulnerable in order to prioritize pollinator conservation efforts the poverty level the population density and the level of pollinator dependence for food provisioning are key aspects to identify vulnerable countries we evaluate these aspects and determine the level of human food provisioning dependence on pollinators in mexico a developing and highly populated country the diversity of crop species in mexico is exceptionally high nearly 85% of fruit and or seed consumed species depend to some degree on pollinators for productivity overall pollinator dependent crops generate larger income but cover a lower cultivated area and produce less volume compared to non pollinator dependent crops volume per unit area however as well as revenue per unit area is much higher for pollinator dependent crops native wild pollinators also play a key role in fruit or seed production of mexican domesticated plant species and in the reproduction of many useful wild species thus assuring free pollination services is particularly important in mexico as the livelihood of a large proportion of the population exclusively and directly depends on ecosystem services for subsistence feasible conservation strategies involve the payment of environmental services to ejidos communal land tenure systems making efforts to protect or restore plant resources and native pollinators and the creation of new protected natural areas which ensures food provision mating and nesting sites for pollinators http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0006320709000512  .",,

In this review we discuss plant diversity patterns in the Scandinavian mountains in a global, regional and local perspective. The main objective was to identify processes that influence diversity at different spatial scales with a particular focus on grazing. In a global perspective the species pool of the Scandinavian mountains is limited. partly reflecting the general latitudinal decline of species but also historical and ecological factors operating after the latest glaciation. At the local scale, both productivity and disturbance are primary factors structuring diversity, but abiotic factors such as soil pH, snow distribution and temperature are also important. Although evidence is scarce, grazing favours local species richness in productive habitats, whereas species richness decreases with grazing when productivity is low. Regional patterns of plant diversity is set by, 1) the species pool. 2) the heterogeneity and fragmentation of communities, and 3) local diversity of each plant community. We suggest that local shifts in community composition depend both on the local grazing frequency and the return-time of the plant community after a grazing session. In addition, an increasing number of grazing-modified local patches homogenises the vegetation and is likely to reduce the regional plant diversity. The time scale of local shifts in community composition depends on plant colonisation and persistence, From a mechanistic point of view, diversity patterns at a regional scale also depend on the regional dynamics of single species. Colonisation is usually a slow and irregular process in alpine environments, whereas the capacity for extended local persistence is generally high. Although the poor knowledge of plant regional dynamics restricts our understanding of how grazing influences plant diversity, we conclude that grazing is a key process for maintaining biodiversity in the Scandinavian mountains.","|CG|","|150-154-|","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2001.tb00530.x/abstract","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2001.tb00530.x","|",".  austrheim g eriksson o plant species diversity and grazing in the scandinavian mountains patterns and processes at different spatial scales ecography john wiley & sons inc there is a long tradition of grazing by semi domestic reindeer and sheep in alpine and sub alpine scandinavian habitats but present management regimes are questioned from a conservation point of view in this review we discuss plant diversity patterns in the scandinavian mountains in a global regional and local perspective the main objective was to identify processes that influence diversity at different spatial scales with a particular focus on grazing in a global perspective the species pool of the scandinavian mountains is limited partly reflecting the general latitudinal decline of species but also historical and ecological factors operating after the latest glaciation at the local scale both productivity and disturbance are primary factors structuring diversity but abiotic factors such as soil ph snow distribution and temperature are also important although evidence is scarce grazing favours local species richness in productive habitats whereas species richness decreases with grazing when productivity is low regional patterns of plant diversity is set by 1 the species pool 2 the heterogeneity and fragmentation of communities and 3 local diversity of each plant community we suggest that local shifts in community composition depend both on the local grazing frequency and the return time of the plant community after a grazing session in addition an increasing number of grazing modified local patches homogenises the vegetation and is likely to reduce the regional plant diversity the time scale of local shifts in community composition depends on plant colonisation and persistence from a mechanistic point of view diversity patterns at a regional scale also depend on the regional dynamics of single species colonisation is usually a slow and irregular process in alpine environments whereas the capacity for extended local persistence is generally high although the poor knowledge of plant regional dynamics restricts our understanding of how grazing influences plant diversity we conclude that grazing is a key process for maintaining biodiversity in the scandinavian mountains http onlinelibrary wiley com doi 10 1111 j 1600 0587 2001 tb00530 x abstract  .",,

This paper identifies the factors that condition a household’s livelihood strategy choice with a particular focus on forest products. For this, we use the livelihood approach as a framework of analysis. Environmentally augmented household income data were collected from 360 sample households in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. On the basis of the share of forest environmental income in total household income, sample households were clustered into distinct livelihood strategies. Student’s t-test and ANOVA were used to test income differences among the clusters. Multinomial logit (MNL) regression on asset-based explanatory variables was run to identify the main factors that determine households’ livelihood strategy choice and forest dependence.

Using data from 360 randomly sampled rural households from 12 villages in Tigray (northern Ethiopia), we measure forest environmental resource use with a monetary yardstick and compares the value of FEPs with other household economic activities. We found that products from environmental sources represent an important component in rural livelihoods. Our analyses indicate that in the study area income from forest environmental sources occupies the second largest share in average total household income next to crop income. Poverty and inequality analyses show that incorporating forest environmental incomes in household accounts significantly reduces measured rural poverty and income inequality.

López and M. Toman",,,,,,"There are currently two types of \"dualism\" in patterns of resource use within developing countries that are very much relevant to the problem of resource degradation and poverty. The first \"dualism\" concerns aggregate resource use and dependency within the global economy. Most low and middle-income economies are highly dependent on the exploitation of natural resources. The second \"dualism\" concerns aggregate resource use and dependency within a developing economy.  A substantial proportion of the population in low and middle-income countries is concentrated in marginal areas and on ecologically 'fragile' land, such as converted forest frontier areas, poor quality uplands, converted wetlands and so forth. This \"dualism within dualism\" pattern is symptomatic of a process of resource-based development that often perpetuates rather than alleviates problems of rural poverty and resource degradation. Development in low and middle-income economies is accompanied by substantial resource conversion that leads often to benefits that are inequitably distributed. Moreover, such problems are exacerbated by government policies that favor wealthier households in markets for key resources, such as land. That is, the abundance of land and natural resources available in many developing countries does not necessarily mean that exploitation of this natural wealth will lead either to sustained economic growth, widespread benefits or substantial rural poverty alleviation. The increased concentration of the rural poor in marginal land and resource areas continues, and this in turn will generate the conditions for additional resource conversion through a process called \"frontier resource expansion\".   <BR>If this \"vicious cycle\" is to be reversed, there are essentially two roles for policy reform within developing economies. First, specific policies must be aimed at overcoming the structural features of \"dualism within dualism\" in resource use patterns. Second, policies must also be introduced that improve the overall success of resource-based development that is accompanied by frontier land expansion. Specific policies include reform of land, tax, credit and other economic policies that generally reinforce the dominance of wealthier households in natural resource and land markets and promote the speculative investment in these resources as tax shelters. Specific investments must overcome the under-investment in human capital in rural areas, particularly by those poor households concentrated on fragile land, who must also be targeted with investments in the agricultural sector to provide effective credit markets and services to remote areas. Better integration between frontier-based activities and more dynamic economic sectors means a greater commitment to promoting \"agro-industrialization\" generally, as well as improving the productivity of frontier lands and resource-based systems.","|PE|GP|","|","http://policydialogue.org/files/publications/02_NaturalCapital_Barbier.PDF",,"|",".  barbier e b natural capital resource dependency and poverty in developing countries the problem of ‘dualism within dualism’ economic development and environmental sustainability r lópez and m toman there are currently two types of dualism in patterns of resource use within developing countries that are very much relevant to the problem of resource degradation and poverty the first dualism concerns aggregate resource use and dependency within the global economy most low and middle income economies are highly dependent on the exploitation of natural resources the second dualism concerns aggregate resource use and dependency within a developing economy a substantial proportion of the population in low and middle income countries is concentrated in marginal areas and on ecologically fragile land such as converted forest frontier areas poor quality uplands converted wetlands and so forth this dualism within dualism pattern is symptomatic of a process of resource based development that often perpetuates rather than alleviates problems of rural poverty and resource degradation development in low and middle income economies is accompanied by substantial resource conversion that leads often to benefits that are inequitably distributed moreover such problems are exacerbated by government policies that favor wealthier households in markets for key resources such as land that is the abundance of land and natural resources available in many developing countries does not necessarily mean that exploitation of this natural wealth will lead either to sustained economic growth widespread benefits or substantial rural poverty alleviation the increased concentration of the rural poor in marginal land and resource areas continues and this in turn will generate the conditions for additional resource conversion through a process called frontier resource expansion if this vicious cycle is to be reversed there are essentially two roles for policy reform within developing economies first specific policies must be aimed at overcoming the structural features of dualism within dualism in resource use patterns second policies must also be introduced that improve the overall success of resource based development that is accompanied by frontier land expansion specific policies include reform of land tax credit and other economic policies that generally reinforce the dominance of wealthier households in natural resource and land markets and promote the speculative investment in these resources as tax shelters specific investments must overcome the under investment in human capital in rural areas particularly by those poor households concentrated on fragile land who must also be targeted with investments in the agricultural sector to provide effective credit markets and services to remote areas better integration between frontier based activities and more dynamic economic sectors means a greater commitment to promoting agro industrialization generally as well as improving the productivity of frontier lands and resource based systems http policydialogue org files publications 02_naturalcapital_barbier pdf  .",,

These ecotones are critical for conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest-agriculture ecotones? (2) How can forest-agriculture ecotones contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture ecotones? We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, in the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE's interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest-agriculture ecotones. Simultaneously, ATREE's interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that play a critical role in the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive, strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture ecotones by the governmental agencies and international organizations.

Fishing in this very remote rural region of DRC is operated both by men and women, as part of a household multiple activity livelihood strategy.

This paper examines the biodiversity conservation implications of providing physical access and IPR protection to foreign consumers of biodiversity. An integrated model of optimal resource extinction and shared resource harvesting game is presented. The model results show that, as foreign and indigenous users compete for the same open-access resource, optimal extinction may occur as a noncooperative equilibrium under certain bioeconomic conditions. Extinction may be prevented by forging successful cooperation between consumers, initiating a joint harvesting process. Depending upon the model parameters, even under cooperation, increased patent protection and physical access either promotes the conservation of biodiversity or enhances its physical exploitation. Patent protection and resource access must, therefore, be developed carefully by biodiversity-rich countries to successfully balance their domestic conservation and socioeconomic goals.","|CG|GP|","|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800998000664","doi:10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00066-4","|",".  bhat m g on biodiversity access intellectual property rights and conservation ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk recent international agreements such as the convention on biological diversity and the trade related intellectual property rights have called for increased mutual transfer of biodiversity and biotechnology between poor and rich countries these agreements also call for the protection of intellectual property rights ipr on biotechnology transferors in the receiving countries this paper examines the biodiversity conservation implications of providing physical access and ipr protection to foreign consumers of biodiversity an integrated model of optimal resource extinction and shared resource harvesting game is presented the model results show that as foreign and indigenous users compete for the same open access resource optimal extinction may occur as a noncooperative equilibrium under certain bioeconomic conditions extinction may be prevented by forging successful cooperation between consumers initiating a joint harvesting process depending upon the model parameters even under cooperation increased patent protection and physical access either promotes the conservation of biodiversity or enhances its physical exploitation patent protection and resource access must therefore be developed carefully by biodiversity rich countries to successfully balance their domestic conservation and socioeconomic goals http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800998000664  .",,

In the beginning, it was the vanishing diversity of locally adapted varieties, fundamentally useful to plant breeders in their efforts to improve crops, that IPGRI helped to collect and protect in ex situ genebanks. IPGRI was then among the first to recognize the crucial role that biodiversity, including forest biodiversity, plays in the farming systems of developed and developing countries. By enhancing the value of biodiversity, IPGRI and its partners helped people to conserve and use diversity in situ on farms.

We first deal with resistance and resilience against abiotic disturbance and stress. There is evidence that soil biodiversity does confer stability to stress and disturbance, but the mechanism is not yet fully understood. It appears to depend on the kind of stress and disturbance and on the combination of stress and disturbance effects. Alternatively, community structure may play a role. Both possible explanations will guide further research. We then discuss biotic stress. There is evidence that soil microbial diversity confers protection against soil-borne disease, but crop and soil type and management also play a role. Their relative importance as well as the role of biodiversity in multitrophic interactions warrant further study. Henceforth, we focus on the effects of plant and soil biodiversity on nutrient and water use efficiencies as important ecological functions in agroecosystems. The available evidence suggests that mycorrhizal diversity positively contributes to nutrient and, possibly, water use efficiency. Soil fauna effects on nutrient and water use efficiencies are also apparent, but diversity effects may be indirect, through effects on soil structure. We present a conceptual diagram relating plant and soil biodiversity with soil structure and water and nutrient use efficiencies as a framework for future studies.

We find that species richness, range-size rarity, and threatened species scores are all significantly higher in these three tropical African mountain ranges than across the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. When compared with the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, human population density is only significantly higher in the Albertine Rift mountains, whereas human infrastructure is only significantly higher in the Albertine Rift and the Cameroon-Nigeria mountains. Statistically there are strong positive correlations between human density and species richness, endemism and density or proportion of threatened species across the three tropical African mountain ranges, and all of sub-Saharan Africa. Kendall partial rank-order correlation shows that across the African tropical mountains human population density, but not human infrastructure, best correlates with biodiversity values. This is not the case across all of sub-Saharan Africa where human density and human infrastructure both correlate almost equally well with biodiversity values. The primary conservation challenge in the African tropical mountains is a fairly dense and poor rural population that is reliant on farming for their livelihood. Conservation strategies have to address agricultural production and expansion, in some cases across the boundaries and into existing reserves. Strategies also have to maintain, or finalise, an adequate protected area network. Such strategies cannot be implemented in conflict with the local population, but have to find ways to provide benefits to the people living adjacent to the remaining forested areas, in return for their assistance in conserving the forest habitats, their biodiversity, and their ecosystem functions.","|PE|Fo|","|002--|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706003326","doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2006.08.024","|",".  burgess n d balmford a cordeiro n j fjeldså j küper w rahbek k sanderson e w scharlemann j p w sommer j h williams w h correlations among species distributions human density and human infrastructure across the high biodiversity tropical mountains of africa biological conservation elsevier science ltd uk this paper explores whether spatial variation in the biodiversity values of vertebrates and plants species richness range size rarity and number or proportion of iucn red listed threatened species of three african tropical mountain ranges eastern arc albertine rift and cameroon nigeria mountains within the biafran forests and highlands co vary with proxy measures of threat human population density and human infrastructure we find that species richness range size rarity and threatened species scores are all significantly higher in these three tropical african mountain ranges than across the rest of sub saharan africa when compared with the rest of sub saharan africa human population density is only significantly higher in the albertine rift mountains whereas human infrastructure is only significantly higher in the albertine rift and the cameroon nigeria mountains statistically there are strong positive correlations between human density and species richness endemism and density or proportion of threatened species across the three tropical african mountain ranges and all of sub saharan africa kendall partial rank order correlation shows that across the african tropical mountains human population density but not human infrastructure best correlates with biodiversity values this is not the case across all of sub saharan africa where human density and human infrastructure both correlate almost equally well with biodiversity values the primary conservation challenge in the african tropical mountains is a fairly dense and poor rural population that is reliant on farming for their livelihood conservation strategies have to address agricultural production and expansion in some cases across the boundaries and into existing reserves strategies also have to maintain or finalise an adequate protected area network such strategies cannot be implemented in conflict with the local population but have to find ways to provide benefits to the people living adjacent to the remaining forested areas in return for their assistance in conserving the forest habitats their biodiversity and their ecosystem functions http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0006320706003326  .",,

Research to date has greatly improved our understanding of how, when, and why species loss alters primary production in ecosystems. However, because experiments have been performed at rather small spatial and short temporal scales, it is unclear whether conclusions can be readily extrapolated to the broader scales at which natural communities are most likely to influence ecosystem functioning. Here we develop a simple patch-dynamics model to examine some of the scale-dependent and independent qualities of the diversity-productivity relationship.We first simulate a typical diversity-productivity experiment and show that the influence of species richness on productivity is temporally dynamic, growing stronger through successional time. This holds true irrespective of whether resource partitioning or a sampling effect is the underlying mechanism. We then increase the spatial scale of the simulation from individual patches to a region consisting of many patch types. Results suggest that the diversity-productivity relationship is not influenced by spatial scale per se, but that the mechanism producing the relationship can change from sampling effects within individual patches to resource partitioning across patch types composing the region. This change occurs even though model dynamics are the same at both scales, suggesting that sampling effects and resource partitioning can represent different descriptions of the same biological processes operating concurrently at differing scales of observation. Lastly, we incorporate regional processes of dispersal and disturbance into the model and show that these processes can amplify the effect of species richness on productivity, resulting in patterns not easily anticipated from experiments. We conclude that the relative control of community structure by local versus regional processes may be a primary determinant of the diversity-productivity relationship in natural ecosystems. Therefore, past experiments having focused only on local processes might not reflect patterns and processes underlying diversity-productivity relationships in communities where disturbance and dispersal regulate species biomasses.","|CG|CC|","|","http://www.snre.umich.edu/cardinale/pdfs/cardinale_oikos_2004.pdf",,"|",".  cardinale b j ives a v inchausti p effects of species diversity on the primary productivity of ecosystems extending our spatial and temporal scale of inference oikos the number of studies examining how species diversity influences the productivity of ecosystems has increased dramatically in the past decade as concern about global loss of biodiversity has intensified research to date has greatly improved our understanding of how when and why species loss alters primary production in ecosystems however because experiments have been performed at rather small spatial and short temporal scales it is unclear whether conclusions can be readily extrapolated to the broader scales at which natural communities are most likely to influence ecosystem functioning here we develop a simple patch dynamics model to examine some of the scale dependent and independent qualities of the diversity productivity relationship we first simulate a typical diversity productivity experiment and show that the influence of species richness on productivity is temporally dynamic growing stronger through successional time this holds true irrespective of whether resource partitioning or a sampling effect is the underlying mechanism we then increase the spatial scale of the simulation from individual patches to a region consisting of many patch types results suggest that the diversity productivity relationship is not influenced by spatial scale per se but that the mechanism producing the relationship can change from sampling effects within individual patches to resource partitioning across patch types composing the region this change occurs even though model dynamics are the same at both scales suggesting that sampling effects and resource partitioning can represent different descriptions of the same biological processes operating concurrently at differing scales of observation lastly we incorporate regional processes of dispersal and disturbance into the model and show that these processes can amplify the effect of species richness on productivity resulting in patterns not easily anticipated from experiments we conclude that the relative control of community structure by local versus regional processes may be a primary determinant of the diversity productivity relationship in natural ecosystems therefore past experiments having focused only on local processes might not reflect patterns and processes underlying diversity productivity relationships in communities where disturbance and dispersal regulate species biomasses http www snre umich edu cardinale pdfs cardinale_oikos_2004 pdf  .",,

This paper explores how agricultural households in the Hararghe region of eastern Ethiopia, an area rich in crop genetic diversity, but with low and variable agricultural productivity and high rates of poverty, manage their crop genetic resources to cope with drought, a prevalent source of agricultural production shocks. Our analysis looks at reasons for cultivating modern varieties versus landrace crop varieties of sorghum, and the implications for farm level resilience to drought as well as choice of coping strategy when such shocks occur. The analysis is run using a unique dataset collected during 2002-2003 production season when eastern Ethiopia experienced a major drought with widespread crop failure ensuing. Our results indicate that there are linkages between crop genetic diversity and the choice of mechanism for coping with drought that households adopt. The results suggest that MV adoption is not an ex ante risk coping strategy, and that indeed households growing modern sorghum varieties are more likely to have a crop failure than those who grow only landrace sorghum. The results indicate also that small and medium producers on marginal lands are most likely to be vulnerable to a crop failure, particularly if they are also MV adopters moreover location is found to be a critical determinant of the choice to replant sorghum. Further analysis is requires to formulate any definitive policy prescriptions, however our results suggest that sorghum MVs despite their early maturity, are not resilient in the face of a drought related production shocks, and that local sorghum crop genetic diversity is an important means of coping with these shocks.

With over 200 color illustrations. The Earth's biodiversity-the rich variety of life on our planet-is disappearing at an alarming rate. And while many books have focused on the expected ecological consequences, or on the aesthetic, ethical, sociological, or economic dimensions of this loss, Sustaining Life is the first book to examine the full range of potential threats that diminishing biodiversity poses to human health. Edited and written by Harvard Medical School physicians Eric Chivian and Aaron Bernstein, along with more than 100 leading scientists who contributed to writing and reviewing the book, Sustaining Life presents a comprehensive--and sobering--view of how human medicines, biomedical research, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and the production of food, both on land and in the oceans, depend on biodiversity. The book's ten chapters cover everything from what biodiversity is and how human activity threatens it to how we as individuals can help conserve the world's richly varied biota. Seven groups of organisms, some of the most endangered on Earth, provide detailed case studies to illustrate the contributions they have already made to human medicine, and those they are expected to make if we do not drive them to extinction.

The programs vary in the extent to which payments are made directly to individuals or to villages and the degree of involvement of local management institutions. The programs were evaluated against three criteria: the institutional arrangements, distribution of costs and benefits, and the conservation results observed. The most direct individual contracts had the simplest institutional arrangements, the lowest administrative costs, disbursed significant payments to individual villagers making a substantial contribution to local livelihoods, and rapidly protected globally significant species. However, this program also failed to build local management organisations or understanding of conservation goals.

However, issues of equity between various forest users are becoming a major challenge to environmental development, forest management and poverty reduction. This paper presents an analysis of household representatives' socio-economic determinants and other constraints on accessing forest products, based on data collected through a questionnaire survey of 1865 respondents in seven districts of the Sissili province, southern Burkina Faso. Three logistic regression models were developed to examine determinants of access to the forest for collecting fuelwood, grazing livestock and collecting non-timber forest products (NTFPs). The results showed that access to forest products is associated with individual characteristics. Age, ethnicity, occupation and sources of income were significant determinants of access to all types of forest products. Access to the forest for grazing livestock was further influenced by gender and household size, while access to NTFPs was influenced by gender, household size and education level of the respondents. The formal forest law that precludes grazing in the forest, and customary rules and regulations pertaining to land tenure, were reported to be serious constraints to forest access for women and migrant people. Understanding the factors influencing access to products from commonly-owned forest resources could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments that promote equitable access. Policies should particularly encourage the direct involvement of vulnerable and marginalized groups (women and migrants) in forest management activities.","|PE|Fo|CS|","|002-011-854|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934109000768","doi:10.1016/j.forpol.2009.06.002","|",".  coulibaly lingani p tigabu m savadogo p oden p c ouadba j m determinants of access to forest products in southern burkina faso forest policy and economics elsevier science ltd uk there is an increasing understanding that forests and the forestry sector are key elements in poverty reduction strategies in africa however issues of equity between various forest users are becoming a major challenge to environmental development forest management and poverty reduction this paper presents an analysis of household representatives socio economic determinants and other constraints on accessing forest products based on data collected through a questionnaire survey of 1865 respondents in seven districts of the sissili province southern burkina faso three logistic regression models were developed to examine determinants of access to the forest for collecting fuelwood grazing livestock and collecting non timber forest products ntfps the results showed that access to forest products is associated with individual characteristics age ethnicity occupation and sources of income were significant determinants of access to all types of forest products access to the forest for grazing livestock was further influenced by gender and household size while access to ntfps was influenced by gender household size and education level of the respondents the formal forest law that precludes grazing in the forest and customary rules and regulations pertaining to land tenure were reported to be serious constraints to forest access for women and migrant people understanding the factors influencing access to products from commonly owned forest resources could form the basis for developing modifying and targeting policy instruments that promote equitable access policies should particularly encourage the direct involvement of vulnerable and marginalized groups women and migrants in forest management activities http www sciencedirect com science article pii s1389934109000768  .",,

Fuel-wood, fodder and green leaves were the major products harvested in this agricultural region. The effect of distance from the reserve boundary differed with the product harvested and its use value. Distance was a constraint for households that harvested for domestic consumption, whereas it was not significant for households that harvested for earnings. Wealth was independent of resource interest in the forest, except for the poorer lower caste households with lower levels of literacy that sold fuel-wood to earn a living. Wealthier households harvested green leaves for fertilizing their fields, and fodder harvest was related to livestock ownership.

Households varied in wealth but all could be considered subject to extreme poverty (income below US$1 per capita per day). Our analyses indicate that wild foods play a small role in household consumption but a major role in household income. Hence, over 90% of both bushmeat and fish production is sold at market. In addition, the value of wild foods increases in the “lean season” when agricultural production is low. We also find that the poorest households in this community are unable to capitalise on the most valuable wild foods, bushmeat and fish, as a source of food or cash income. We use an entitlements framework to explain the factors that determine such wealth-related variation between households, indicating that household use of wild foods is determined more by social and economic constraints than by resource abundance in this community.

In particular, the consumption of NTFPs allows gatherers to live with lower amounts of cash than if they had to buy in the market what they can obtain from the forest for free. Understanding the economic value of non-marketed NTFPs helps determine the true income of the gatherers, and the amount of extra cash that they would need if they could no longer gather NTFPs. It also helps ascertain the true value of the standing forest, leading to more rational decisions about its alternative uses. Yet, the NTFPs that are not marketed are often ignored when estimates are made of the economic importance of NTFPs to rural populations.

Much of their energy goes into coping with these shocks and into day-to-day survival. While insurance and credit markets, combined with widespread socialsecurity, provide an important cushion against poverty in rich countries, the need for immediate survival may lock the poor into persistent poverty in developing countries.The poor in developing countries do have informal mechanisms to cope with risk and misfortune. These are based on income diversification, risk avoidance, self-insurance by saving together with family, and community-based mutual assistance. Nevertheless, the scope of these mechanisms remains limited.Repeated individual-specific shocks such as illness or pests, or covariate risks associated with drought, flood, or recession, undermine the ability of individuals and their families to cope with risk.We now know much more about vulnerability to risk and how poor people cope. Even more importantly, we have learned much about the large long-term consequences of these risks, which condemns many to persistent poverty and excludes them from economic growth. But there is much that can be done. The micro-level studies that underpin this book offer new insights on how effective public action could be more effective in protecting the vulnerable against persistent poverty. Policy should focus on providing a comprehensive menu of ex-ante and post-crisis protection mechanisms, including new formsof insurance, savings, safety nets, and the means to strengthen the poor's asset base. Local communities have a big role to play: public funds should not be used to replace indigenous community-based support networks; rather they should be used to build on the strengths of these networks to ensurebroader and more effective protection.With numerous thematic chapters and case studies of both best practice and of failure, from a mix of low-income and middle-income countries across the developing world, this book evaluates alternatives in widening insurance and protection provision, and makes an important contribution to the topicalfield of insurance and risk.","|MA|GP|","|","http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=75DC-ZVUPoUC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=Insurance+Against+Poverty&ots=gpjnh-AxhN&sig=-DHWXtesKjhJjl_o_WJhMaGtbkM",,"|",".  dercon s insurance against poverty oxford university press poor people in developing countries are often affected by droughts floods illness crop failure job loss and economic downturns much of their energy goes into coping with these shocks and into day to day survival while insurance and credit markets combined with widespread socialsecurity provide an important cushion against poverty in rich countries the need for immediate survival may lock the poor into persistent poverty in developing countries the poor in developing countries do have informal mechanisms to cope with risk and misfortune these are based on income diversification risk avoidance self insurance by saving together with family and community based mutual assistance nevertheless the scope of these mechanisms remains limited repeated individual specific shocks such as illness or pests or covariate risks associated with drought flood or recession undermine the ability of individuals and their families to cope with risk we now know much more about vulnerability to risk and how poor people cope even more importantly we have learned much about the large long term consequences of these risks which condemns many to persistent poverty and excludes them from economic growth but there is much that can be done the micro level studies that underpin this book offer new insights on how effective public action could be more effective in protecting the vulnerable against persistent poverty policy should focus on providing a comprehensive menu of ex ante and post crisis protection mechanisms including new formsof insurance savings safety nets and the means to strengthen the poor s asset base local communities have a big role to play public funds should not be used to replace indigenous community based support networks; rather they should be used to build on the strengths of these networks to ensurebroader and more effective protection with numerous thematic chapters and case studies of both best practice and of failure from a mix of low income and middle income countries across the developing world this book evaluates alternatives in widening insurance and protection provision and makes an important contribution to the topicalfield of insurance and risk http books google co uk books hl=en&lr=&id=75dc zvupouc&oi=fnd&pg=pr5&dq=insurance against poverty&ots=gpjnh axhn&sig= dhwxteskjhjjl_o_wjhmagtbkm  .",,

This is because most of the herbs grow in impoverished species communities and lands, often referred to as ‘marginal lands’. The aim of this paper is to conceptualize how the economics of wild edible herbs to households can be used to add value to total livelihoods and conservation within traditional communal areas of South Africa. Analysis of the economics of the consumption of wild edible herbs in Thorndale (Bushbuckridge district) of the Limpopo province is presented. The majority of households consumed wild edible herbs, averaging 15.4 kg dried weight per household per year and valued at $167 per household. The herbs were mostly harvested from uncultivated areas of farms, and rangelands. There was little correlation between household characteristics and the dependence on wild herbs for food. The local people noted a decline in the availability of the species, although not much is known about attempts to cultivate them. The only reasons attributed to the decline were nutrient poor soils and insufficient rains. With this background, developing a local strategy to sustain the species through cultivation by households was found to be feasible. A multiple-use system for the herbs, their improvement and value addition towards commercialization and increased household usage may result in wider acceptance and subsequent cultivation. Species diversity will be enhanced whilst conserving the land on which they grow. This multiple use system may include species roles in soil and water conservation.","|PE|","|002-018-710|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479706002027","doi:10.1016/j.jenvman.2006.05.017","|",".  dovie d b k shackleton c m witkowski e t f conceptualizing the human use of wild edible herbs for conservation in south african communal areas journal of environmental management elsevier science ltd uk the importance of wild edible herbaceous species to resource poor households in most rural economies within savannas has been little studied this is because most of the herbs grow in impoverished species communities and lands often referred to as ‘marginal lands’ the aim of this paper is to conceptualize how the economics of wild edible herbs to households can be used to add value to total livelihoods and conservation within traditional communal areas of south africa analysis of the economics of the consumption of wild edible herbs in thorndale bushbuckridge district of the limpopo province is presented the majority of households consumed wild edible herbs averaging 15 4 kg dried weight per household per year and valued at $167 per household the herbs were mostly harvested from uncultivated areas of farms and rangelands there was little correlation between household characteristics and the dependence on wild herbs for food the local people noted a decline in the availability of the species although not much is known about attempts to cultivate them the only reasons attributed to the decline were nutrient poor soils and insufficient rains with this background developing a local strategy to sustain the species through cultivation by households was found to be feasible a multiple use system for the herbs their improvement and value addition towards commercialization and increased household usage may result in wider acceptance and subsequent cultivation species diversity will be enhanced whilst conserving the land on which they grow this multiple use system may include species roles in soil and water conservation http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0301479706002027  .",,

We start with a discussion of PES definition and scope. We proceed to review some of the principal dimensions and design characteristics of PES programs and then analyze how PES compares to alternative policy instruments. Finally, we examine in detail two important aspects of PES programs: their effectiveness and their distributional implications.<BR>PES is not a silver bullet that can be used to address any environmental problem, but a tool tailored to address a specific set of problems: those in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of ecosystem managers. PES is based on the beneficiary-pays rather than the polluter-pays principle, and as such is attractive in settings where ES providers are poor, marginalized landholders or powerful groups of actors. An important distinction within PES is between user-financed PES in which the buyers are the users of the ES, and government-financed PES in which the buyers are others (typically the government) acting on behalf of ES users. In practice, PES programs differ in the type and scale of ES demand, the payment source, the type of activity paid for, the performance measure used, as well as the payment mode and amount.

Since most hotspots occur in countries where poverty is widespread, the success of conservation efforts depends upon the recognition that poverty can be a significant constraint on conservation, and at the same time conservation is an important component to the alleviation of long-term poverty. In this paper we present five key socio-economic poverty indicators (access to water, undernourishment, potential population pressure, number living below poverty line and debt service) and integrate them with an ecologically based hotspots analysis in order to illustrate magnitude of the overlap between biological conservation and poverty.

For rice, where germplasm and genetic data have been collected throughout South and Southeast Asia over many decades, contrary to popular opinion, we have been unable to detect a significant reduction of available genetic diversity in our study material. This absence of a decline may be viewed positively; over the 33-year timescale of our study, genetic diversity amongst landraces grown in traditional agricultural systems was still sufficiently abundant to be collected for ex situ conservation. However, if significant genetic erosion does take place in the future as a result of accelerating global warming and/or major changes in land use or agricultural practices, will it be catastrophic or gradual, and how will it be detected? We have shown a strong link between numbers of landraces collected (and therefore extant) and genetic diversity; hence, we have a clear indicator to detect loss of genetic diversity in the future. Our findings lend considerable support for ex situ conservation of germplasm; the more than substantial genetic resources already in genebanks are now safe.

Despite strides made in reducing hunger, there remains a formidable health challenge posed by obesity, nutrient deficiencies, or dietary lack of non&#8208;nutrient health protecting phyto&#8208;chemicals found in legumes, fruits and vegetables. Micronutrient deficiencies continue to be addressed largely through single&#8208;nutrient based interventions that require significant resource investments. Rapid environmental changes are associated with the worsening global food, nutrition and health situation. Overpopulation, ecosystem destruction and loss of biodiversity, food production strategies that focus on few crops – maize, rice and wheat, resulting in reduced consumption of legumes, fruits and vegetables are all associated with urbanization and changing lifestyles, dietary simplification and its negative health impacts. Emerging research and epidemiological evidence link lack of dietary diversity to the growing incidence of chronic diseases. Increases in non&#8208;communicable diseases have been associated with shifts in dietary patterns in urban, peri&#8208;urban and rural communities where traditional food systems are breaking down and the shift is towards Western&#8208;type cereal&#8208;based high energy diets. How can this complex situation be redressed? Food based strategies are key to addressing global hunger and malnutrition, and maintaining biodiversity in the food systems is essential for ensuring food security, adequate nutrition and health. Success of these strategies requires aggressive promotion of indigenous foods whose nutritional and health protecting properties are increasingly being ascertained, and the incorporation of hitherto unemployed traditional and indigenous food systems into nutrition intervention strategies. Such strategies would then be based upon an ecosystem approach that maximises the “fruits” of our environment for food, better nutrition and health.","|Ag|PE|","|","http://www2.bioversityinternational.org/Themes/Nutrition/Cross-cutting_Initiative/pdf/Using_biodiversity.pdf",,"|",".  frison e smith i f johns t cherfas j eyzaguirre p using biodiversity for food dietary diversity better nutrition and health south african journal of clinical nutrition medpharm publications pty ltdhttp www2 bioversityinternational org themes nutrition cross cutting_initiative pdf using_biodiversity pdf a significant proportion of the diverse foods available in our environment have been neglected as technological options focus on few staple foods to address global food security and hunger despite strides made in reducing hunger there remains a formidable health challenge posed by obesity nutrient deficiencies or dietary lack of non&#8208;nutrient health protecting phyto&#8208;chemicals found in legumes fruits and vegetables micronutrient deficiencies continue to be addressed largely through single&#8208;nutrient based interventions that require significant resource investments rapid environmental changes are associated with the worsening global food nutrition and health situation overpopulation ecosystem destruction and loss of biodiversity food production strategies that focus on few crops – maize rice and wheat resulting in reduced consumption of legumes fruits and vegetables are all associated with urbanization and changing lifestyles dietary simplification and its negative health impacts emerging research and epidemiological evidence link lack of dietary diversity to the growing incidence of chronic diseases increases in non&#8208;communicable diseases have been associated with shifts in dietary patterns in urban peri&#8208;urban and rural communities where traditional food systems are breaking down and the shift is towards western&#8208;type cereal&#8208;based high energy diets how can this complex situation be redressed food based strategies are key to addressing global hunger and malnutrition and maintaining biodiversity in the food systems is essential for ensuring food security adequate nutrition and health success of these strategies requires aggressive promotion of indigenous foods whose nutritional and health protecting properties are increasingly being ascertained and the incorporation of hitherto unemployed traditional and indigenous food systems into nutrition intervention strategies such strategies would then be based upon an ecosystem approach that maximises the “fruits” of our environment for food better nutrition and health http www2 bioversityinternational org themes nutrition cross cutting_initiative pdf using_biodiversity pdf  .",,

During 1998–2004, we conducted an annual survey of households in the two villages, Baka and Daka, which represent different stages in the shift from a subsistence agroecosystem to a rubber plantation-dominated system in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. Significant negative correlations were observed between gross income and dependence on NTFPs-generated income in both Baka and Daka villages (P = 0.029 in Baka and P = 0.028 in Daka), which is supporting evidence that poorer households derive greater benefits from NTFPs than do wealthy households. When the rubber price dropped during 1998–2001, the NTFPs income of Baka increased greatly from US$59.10 to US$145 per household, or from 6.4% to 26.6% of household gross income. In contrast, in Daka village, NTFPs income increased by insignificant amounts of US$1.6 per household in 1998 to US$23.8 in 2001, but this was compensated by an increase in income from off-farm work of US$11 to US$147 (an increase from 1.8% to 16.2% of gross income per household) from 1998 to 2001 in Daka.

Management of NTFPs through CFUGs is an important poverty-reduction strategy in rural Nepal. National policy documents encourage management of NTFPs by CFUGs for commercial purposes, particularly by involving marginalized communities. It is therefore important to understand the existing mechanisms of their involvement. We followed a case study approach and collected data through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, formal and informal discussions, participant observations, and study of secondary data, such as the constitutions and operational plans of the CFUGs. Because institutional arrangements varied across the 3 study CFUGs, the ability of marginalized people to benefit from the commercial management of NTFPs also differed. Results suggest that the involvement of external agencies, and the consequent conducting of NTFP-based pro-poor programs, positively influences commercial management of NTFPs and minimizes elite domination. Likewise, inclusion of representatives of marginalized people in the CFUG executive committees empowers them to lobby with external agencies for pro-poor programs. Furthermore, the geographic location of the community forest limits the involvement of external agencies and marketing of NTFPs. Therefore, because members of CFUGs in remote areas are heavily dependent on collection and sale of NTFPs for their livelihoods, we suggest increasing the focus of external agencies in such areas and including marginalized people in CFUG executive committees.","|Fo|CC|CS|","|142-062-524|","http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1659/mrd.00051","doi:10.1659/mrd.00051","|",".  gauli k hauser m pro poor commercial management of non timber forest products in nepal s community forest user groups factors for success mountain research and development bioone this article explores the factors that influence pro poor commercial management of non timber forest products ntfps in 3 community forest user groups cfugs in the dolakha district in nepal management of ntfps through cfugs is an important poverty reduction strategy in rural nepal national policy documents encourage management of ntfps by cfugs for commercial purposes particularly by involving marginalized communities it is therefore important to understand the existing mechanisms of their involvement we followed a case study approach and collected data through key informant interviews focus group discussions formal and informal discussions participant observations and study of secondary data such as the constitutions and operational plans of the cfugs because institutional arrangements varied across the 3 study cfugs the ability of marginalized people to benefit from the commercial management of ntfps also differed results suggest that the involvement of external agencies and the consequent conducting of ntfp based pro poor programs positively influences commercial management of ntfps and minimizes elite domination likewise inclusion of representatives of marginalized people in the cfug executive committees empowers them to lobby with external agencies for pro poor programs furthermore the geographic location of the community forest limits the involvement of external agencies and marketing of ntfps therefore because members of cfugs in remote areas are heavily dependent on collection and sale of ntfps for their livelihoods we suggest increasing the focus of external agencies in such areas and including marginalized people in cfug executive committees http www bioone org doi abs 10 1659 mrd 00051  .",,

Traditional medicines remain an important health-care service among African indigenous cultures. In South Africa, medicinal plant use (bark, roots, bulbs, and herbs) threatens biodiversity and the sustainability of this informal industry. Several realities have stimulated experimental and adaptive management research into cultivation of key high-demand medicinal plant species in and around the home gardens of poor rural communities for domestic use and for trade: declining supplies, localized extinctions, increasing market prices, and economic opportunities for commercializing traditional medicinal products.<BR>Objective and methods. This paper reviews three recent South African studies aiming to create alternative medicinal plant resources to reduce dependency on the dwindling wild resources: commercial production of medicinal crop plants; chemistry of wild versus cultivated plants, and of bark versus leaves; and growing of forest tree seedlings in rural home gardens.<BR>Results. Cultivation trials and chemical testing indicated that different agricultural treatments suit each species differently in terms of either rapid growth rates, strong chemical concentrations, or both. Wild-harvested plants of some species have stronger chemical concentrations than cultivated plants. For several tree species, the bark and leaves contain the same active components associated with healing.<BR>Conclusions. Successful propagation is not dependent on elaborate and expensive equipment and technologies, but rather on some basic principles of plant growth and methods of manipulating these under controlled conditions. An alternative cultivation method for tree species is the production of leaves as opposed to bark. Cultivation could be done successfully at the school, in home gardens, and in production systems in the village.","|Ag|PE|CS|","|002-018-710|","http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nsinf/fnb/2007/00000028/A00202s2/art00019",,"|",".  geldenhuys c j weeds or useful medicinal plants in the rural home garden food and nutrition bulletin publishing technology background traditional medicines remain an important health care service among african indigenous cultures in south africa medicinal plant use bark roots bulbs and herbs threatens biodiversity and the sustainability of this informal industry several realities have stimulated experimental and adaptive management research into cultivation of key high demand medicinal plant species in and around the home gardens of poor rural communities for domestic use and for trade declining supplies localized extinctions increasing market prices and economic opportunities for commercializing traditional medicinal products objective and methods this paper reviews three recent south african studies aiming to create alternative medicinal plant resources to reduce dependency on the dwindling wild resources commercial production of medicinal crop plants; chemistry of wild versus cultivated plants and of bark versus leaves; and growing of forest tree seedlings in rural home gardens results cultivation trials and chemical testing indicated that different agricultural treatments suit each species differently in terms of either rapid growth rates strong chemical concentrations or both wild harvested plants of some species have stronger chemical concentrations than cultivated plants for several tree species the bark and leaves contain the same active components associated with healing conclusions successful propagation is not dependent on elaborate and expensive equipment and technologies but rather on some basic principles of plant growth and methods of manipulating these under controlled conditions an alternative cultivation method for tree species is the production of leaves as opposed to bark cultivation could be done successfully at the school in home gardens and in production systems in the village http www ingentaconnect com content nsinf fnb 2007 00000028 a00202s2 art00019  .",,

Three villages with different degrees of access to markets for sale of forest products, in an area of high poverty and forest dependence in the dry tropical forest belt in central India, were examined. The village with the greatest access to the market had a greater proportion of income coming from non-forest sources, the least dependence on NTFP harvest and the most degraded forests. The strongest forest institution was found in the village closest to the market, owing largely to its access to support from the Forest Department. This emphasizes the extreme vulnerability of forest villages located distant from local markets, which are forced to depend on forests for most of their livelihood and income requirements, and left to deal with degrading forests in the absence of technical and financial support from the Forest Department.

Studies of biodiversity are thus assuming greater significance as ecologists try desperately to document global biodiversity in the face of unprecedented perturbations, habitat loss and extinction rates. How will such decline in biodiversity affect the biosphere and the quality of human life on the planet? Does biodiversity matter? Internationally, research has begun to investigate whether the current unprecedented losses in biodiversity will damage the functioning of ecosystems. This paper reviews this work and highlights the general patterns identified. Scientific evidence continues to show that, in general, biodiversity does influence the rates or nature of ecosystem processes, and a majority of studies have found that a reduction in biodiversity does have a negative effect on ecosystem function.

Traditional perspectives held that ecological systems exist close to a steady state and resilience is the ability of the system to return rapidly to that state following perturbation. However, beginning with the work of C.S. Holling in the early 1970s, researchers began to look at conditions far from the steady state where instabilities can cause a system to shift into an entirely different regime of behaviour, and where resilience is measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system is restructured.

On average, agroecological plots on sustainable farms had more topsoil, higher field moisture, more vegetation, less erosion and lower economic losses after the hurricane than control plots on conventional farms. The differences in favor of agroecological plots tended to increase with increasing levels of storm intensity, increasing slope and years under agroecological practices, though the patterns of resistance suggested complex interactions and thresholds. For some indicators agroecological resistance collapsed under extreme stress.<BR>With the help of 19 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 45 farmer–technician teams, 833 farmers measured key agroecological indicators on 880 plots paired under the same topographical conditions.

The broad geographical coverage took into account the diversity of ecological conditions, a variety of practices common to sustainable agriculture in Nicaragua, and moderate, high and extreme levels of hurricane impact.

The challenge is to understand the combined ecological and social functions of agrobiodiversity, determine its contribution to ecosystem goods and services and value for society at large, and evaluate options for the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity across the agricultural landscape. Agrobiodiversity is most likely to enhance agroecosystem functioning when assemblages of species are added whose presence results in unique or complementary effects on ecosystem functioning, e.g., by planting genotypes with genes for higher yield or pest resistance, mixing specific genotypes of crops, or including functional groups that increase nutrient inputs and cycling. Simply adding more species to most agroecosystems may have little effect on function, given the redundancy in many groups, especially for soil organisms. The adoption of biodiversity-based practices for agriculture, however, is only partially based on the provision of ecosystem goods and services, since individual farmers typically react to the private use value of biodiversity, not the ‘external’ benefits of conservation that accrue to the wider society. Evaluating the actual value associated with goods and services provided by agrobiodiversity requires better communication between ecologists and economists, and the realization of the consequences of either overrating its value based on ‘received wisdom’ about potential services, or underrating it by only acknowledging its future option or quasi-option value. Partnerships between researchers, farmers, and other stakeholders to integrate ecological and socioeconomic research help evaluate ecosystem services, the tradeoffs of different management scenarios, and the potential for recognition or rewards for provision of ecosystem services.

We develop a quantitative livelihood approach, using factor and cluster analysis to group households based on the use of their main assets. This resulted in seven household categories that pursue similar livelihood strategies. We use a multinomial logit model to show that livelihood strategies are determined by comparative advantages as reflected by a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic variables. While 92% of the rural hillsides population in Honduras lives on US$1.00/capita/day or less, households that follow a livelihood strategy based on basic grain farming are the poorest because they often live in isolated areas with relatively poor agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions. Opportunities for off-farm work tend to be limited in these areas and household strategies that combine on-farm work with off-farm work earn higher incomes. Per capita incomes can be increased by improving road infrastructure, widening access to land, policies that reduce household size and dependency ratios, and adoption of sustainable land management technologies that restore soil fertility.

Households that rely on basic grain farming are the poorest because they are often located in isolated areas with relatively poor agroecological and socioeconomic conditions. Opportunities for off-farm work tend to be limited in these areas, and household strategies that combine on-farm work with off-farm work generate higher incomes.Soil fertility has a strong, direct, and positive impact on income, while agro climatic conditions such as higher rainfall and altitude have an indirect positive income effect because they stimulate more remunerative livelihood strategies. Land is not the key constraint limiting the potential for higher incomes in the study regions; more land per se does not lead to higher income per capita, and households withless land are able to compensate by obtaining higher productivity or by pursuing off-farm activities. Land tenure also has no impact on crop productivity and household income, but adoption of sustainable land use practices is higher on owner-operated plots than on leased ones.<BR>Ownership of machinery and equipment enables households to raise labor and land productivity and is especially helpful for households with relatively high opportunity costs for labor, such as those pursuing off-farm employment or coffee production.

Analyses of local deforestation examine the significance of numerous explanatory variables for the extraction of forest products. This study distinguishes among the explanatory variables as household-specific and site-specific, and argues for in-depth analysis of household-specific variables. It examines the role of household size, income, and education on firewood extraction and beedi-making in the Western Ghats of India, a hotspot of biodiversity. The study documents the incidence of these livelihoods, investigates the interaction among the three variables, and uses logistic regression models to determine the exact probability for the livelihoods. Two novel features of the study include analysis of wood and non-wood extraction through a single dataset and determination of model by the data.

At the same time, the State government lacks financial resources and skilled manpower to manage the protected forest lands adequately. The present strategies to manage protected forest areas are inadequate to overcome these constraints. Alternative strategies are needed to conserve Kelantan's forest biodiversity. Furthermore, conservation efforts will not be effective without the active cooperation and participation of people living in and near the forest areas. To achieve this, it is essential that the people share the benefits and responsibilities of forest resource management with the state government.<BR>A proposal to involve the local people in an integrated action plan is discussed in this paper. It aims to find options of protecting forest land encroachment in the State with an ultimate goal of increasing the capacity of the poor to carry out activities on a sustained basis. It is hoped that the proposed project will help the State government to improve economic status as well as environmental awareness and reduced dependence on forest lands.<BR>Much of the forest lands in Kelantan are threatened by encroachment from the people who live around the forest areas. This encroachment is not only the result of poverty and shortage of land, but is also due to the unclear forest boundaries. People also do not understand the significance of forest biodiversity. It is important therefore that the local people are encouraged not to encroach into the forest areas. There has to be support from the top in order to sustain integration efforts. Both the State and the central government agencies must be a part of the planning and implementation process.

The poorest segment depends more on forest income than the least poor group, but the medium income group exhibits the highest dependence. Fuelwood constitutes the major source of such income followed by fodder. The incomes mainly support current consumption. People with better access to the forest reserve have higher total income, forest income, and relative forest income. As revealed through a Gini-coefficient analysis, forest resources have an important income equalizing effect across rural households. A particular group of resource poor farmers (8.1% of sample), with little access to agricultural land and a high representation of female heads, derives an average of 65% of their income from the forest.

The past decade has witnessed an increasing emphasis on community-based forest management, with transference of forest management responsibility into the hands of local communities. However, although community forestry (CF) has succeeded in halting resource degradation and conservation of biodiversity, the equity aspect of CF not been fully examined. Nepal is a good location for a case study to examine this question, as community forest programs have been in place longer than in many other countries. This study analyzes the relationship between key household characteristics and common property resources used in order to assess whether poorer households are able to gain greater access to community forests as a result of institutional change.

Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial because two types of mechanism may operate in combination. In the 'selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the 'complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.","|CG|","|","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6842/full/412072a0.html","doi:10.1038/35083573","|",".  loreau m hector a partitioning selection and complementarity in biodiversity experiments nature nature publishing group the impact of biodiversity loss on the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide ecological services has become a central issue in ecology several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production the interpretation of these experiments however has been controversial because two types of mechanism may operate in combination in the selection effect dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes in the complementarity effect resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the price equation in evolutionary genetics applying this method to data from the pan european biodepth experiment reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities depending on whether species with lower or higher than average biomass dominate communities in contrast the complementarity effect is positive overall supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in european grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation http www nature com nature journal v412 n6842 full 412072a0 html  .",,

There is no simple relationship between changing resource availability and shifting patterns of consumption and sale of gathered produce: socio&#8208;economic changes and changing preferences are important influences on consumption, whereas the emergence of markets for gathered resources is related to processes of specialization and exchange rather than physical scarcity. There has been an overall decrease in the diversity of gathered produce eaten, with increased dependence on ‘weeds’ and ‘pests’ gathered from privately used land (homeyards, gardens and fields).

The relative importance of forest product sale as smallholder insurance, Eastern Honduras","Pa","Paper presented at The International Conference on Rural Livelihoods, Forests and Biodiversity 19-23 May 2003, Bonn, Germany",,,,,,,"Tropical forest resources are known to reduce local residents’ vulnerability to income shocks. But what explains differential use of this ‘natural insurance’ policy among households, and how does it compare with alternative forms of self-insurance? The research described here explores these questions by testing the degree to which earnings from forest product sale are used to cover the cost of idiosyncratic shocks, including crop shortfall, illness, and death. Drawing on a 1998 survey of 116 indigenous households in the Tawahka Asangni Biosphere Reserve of eastern Honduras, this paper finds that commercial forest extraction is neither universal among Tawahka households, nor a primary form of insurance for most (the most common strategy is to solicit loans from kin and neighbors). In addition, results indicate that those most likely to sell forest products in the wake of misfortune are: a) households in the early stages of the life cycle (young and undercapitalized, they cannot liquidate household assets or rely on harvest surpluses), and b) those experiencing forms of calamity—such as children’s illness—that do not significantly compromise the scarce household labor needed in extractive activities.

One frequently recommended instrument is to intensify farming systems in the adjacent areas, so as to decrease the need to harvest resources from national parks. This study examined this issue by analyzing the effects of different household land uses in villages near a national park on their propensity to harvest resources from the park. In the northern part of the Kerinci Seblat National Park (Sumatra Island, Indonesia) the park buffer zone is comprised largely of community or village forests and human settlements. The village forests were formerly managed as production forests and provided significant cash income to the village. They were converted into farmland, particularly to mixed-tree gardens or agroforests. Natural forest coverage has now declined to 10% of the former area within village forest land. We analyzed the characteristics of the mixed gardens and village forests, and their practical contribution to reducing farmers' dependence on the adjacent national park resources. Households with farms that were more diversified were found to have much less dependency on the national park resources. Households that farmed only wetland rice fields registered the highest value of forest products obtained from inside the park.

Our study of households in Jhabua, India, finds a more complex relationship. Using the share of resource income in total long-run or “permanent” income as our dependence measure—which we argue is more appropriate than the short-run income-based measure commonly used in the literature—we find that for households that collect any resources at all, dependence exhibits a U-shaped relationship with income. That is, the poorest and richest households depend more on resources than households with intermediate incomes. The poorest and richest households are also found to be least likely to collect, however, indicating that resource use at the income extremes is bimodal—either zero or above average. Moreover, the observed trends for resources as a whole are not mirrored in those for individual resources. Dependence on fuelwood and dung declines with income, for example, while dependence on fodder and construction wood increases.

The feasibility of CBWM based on meat cropping was therefore evaluated in New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve (NDUFR). Comparison of relative wildlife densities with West Kilombero Scarp Forest Reserve, which is subject to only low hunting pressure, indicate that most relevant populations are severely depleted (Cephalophus monticola, C. harveyi and C. spadix, Potamochoerus larvatus) and hence that sustainable harvesting currently is not possible in NDUFR. Records of catch from hunters in the villages surrounding NDUFR indicate that bushmeat is of relatively low importance in terms of use and contribution to protein intake. Proximity to NDUFR and secondarily population size in the different villages is positively correlated with hunting intensity and depletion of wildlife. Comparisons between hunters and non-hunters in terms of wealth measures show that hunting is linked to poverty and low protein intake. An estimation of maximum sustainable harvest in NDUFR reveals that CBWM only has limited capacity to reduce these causes of hunting, maintain the communities’ interest and offset the opportunity costs of conservation. Results of this study suggest that conservation efforts in NDUFR should focus on protecting wildlife against exploitation instead of encouraging use and dependence through CBWM. Supporting efforts should attempt to facilitate a complete shift to domestic sources of meat, by increasing the number of domestic animals in the poorest part of the population.","|CB|PE|CS|","|002-014-|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705004362","doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2005.10.017","|",".  nielsen m r importance cause and effect of bushmeat hunting in the udzungwa mountains tanzania implications for community based wildlife management biological conservation elsevier science ltd uk community based wildlife management cbwm has been suggested as a conservation strategy in response to bushmeat hunting in the udzungwa mountains within the eastern afromontane biodiversity hotspot the feasibility of cbwm based on meat cropping was therefore evaluated in new dabaga ulangambi forest reserve ndufr comparison of relative wildlife densities with west kilombero scarp forest reserve which is subject to only low hunting pressure indicate that most relevant populations are severely depleted cephalophus monticola c harveyi and c spadix potamochoerus larvatus and hence that sustainable harvesting currently is not possible in ndufr records of catch from hunters in the villages surrounding ndufr indicate that bushmeat is of relatively low importance in terms of use and contribution to protein intake proximity to ndufr and secondarily population size in the different villages is positively correlated with hunting intensity and depletion of wildlife comparisons between hunters and non hunters in terms of wealth measures show that hunting is linked to poverty and low protein intake an estimation of maximum sustainable harvest in ndufr reveals that cbwm only has limited capacity to reduce these causes of hunting maintain the communities’ interest and offset the opportunity costs of conservation results of this study suggest that conservation efforts in ndufr should focus on protecting wildlife against exploitation instead of encouraging use and dependence through cbwm supporting efforts should attempt to facilitate a complete shift to domestic sources of meat by increasing the number of domestic animals in the poorest part of the population http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0006320705004362  .",,

Here, the local community is dependent on land and its resources for livelihoods, but the demand and competition is increasing, endangering both the resources they depend on and threatening environmental health. Amboseli is an Arid and Semi-Arid Land (ASAL) area that experiences ecological constraints, resource limitations, and low economic investment. Local communities in such landscapes are resource-dependent for their daily livelihoods, and have few socio-economic opportunities. Pastoralism, which is the main source of their wealth, continues to decline and exploitation by a few local elites and poor local leadership further depresses livelihoods. Other challenges to these poor rural landscapes are increasing human population which increases demands on natural resources and environment; persistent hunger; low universal primary education; poor gender equality and empowerment of women; environmental degradation; and lack of local and global partnership for development.

A theoretical bio-economic model is used to derive a hypothesis about the effect of the state of biodiversity on the optimal crop output both in the longer run and in the transitional path towards the steady-state equilibrium. The hypothesised positive relationship between biodiversity stock and optimal levels of crop output is empirically tested using a stochastic production frontier approach, based on data from a panel of UK specialised cereal farms for the period 1989-2000. The results support the theoretical hypothesis. Increases in biodiversity can lead to a continual outward shift in the output frontier (although at a decreasing rate), controlling for the relevant set of labour and capital inputs.

It shows that in biodiversity poor agroecosystems both agro-biodiversity and conventional input intensification may increase through optimal adjustments of input use. Increase in agro-biodiversity conservation is a necessary condition for optimal adjustment to equilibrium but whether input use will increase or decrease along this optimal path depends on the buffering effect of agro-biodiversity on ecosystem damage and the relative welfare impacts of output reductions and ecosystem damage. The model points out that ecosystem damage (through agro-biodiversity loss) can decline even under increased agricultural intensification.","|Ag|","|","http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/disciplines/economics/research/discussionpapers/pdf/EDP-0807.pdf",,"|",".  omer a pascual u russell n a note on sustainable agricultural intensification through agro biodiversity conservation the school of economics discussion paper series 0807 university of manchester economics this paper addresses the relationship between agro biodiversity conservation and sustainable agricultural intensification it shows that in biodiversity poor agroecosystems both agro biodiversity and conventional input intensification may increase through optimal adjustments of input use increase in agro biodiversity conservation is a necessary condition for optimal adjustment to equilibrium but whether input use will increase or decrease along this optimal path depends on the buffering effect of agro biodiversity on ecosystem damage and the relative welfare impacts of output reductions and ecosystem damage the model points out that ecosystem damage through agro biodiversity loss can decline even under increased agricultural intensification http www socialsciences manchester ac uk disciplines economics research discussionpapers pdf edp 0807 pdf  .",,

The study revealed that wild plants were recognized by rural communities as common property and were managed through common property regimes. Wild plant products used by rural communities met a wide variety of uses and were available for sale in marketplaces within the rural areas. The study demonstrated that when compared across the three ecological zones, the volume of plant products was inversely related to the income they generated. For example, the volume of wild plant products harvested from natural forests was highest in the guinea savannah, followed by the derived savannah, and least in the rainforest; however, the annual household income generated from wild plants was highest in the rainforest and least in the guinea savannah. The wild plant products supported 11 occupations, including production of oils, soap making, gathering (of leaves, fruits, nuts, and seeds), carving, and production of chewing sticks (for oral hygiene). The most promising occupations were vegetable oil production, production of chewing sticks, soap making, production of wines, gathering, and fuel wood and charcoal production. The average annual value of harvested wild plant products from the forest (including items consumed, sold, given out to neighbors, and damaged after harvest) per household was 1,614,133 naira (N1,614,133), or US$11,956.54; the annual net income generated from the harvest of wild plant products per household was N910,252 (US$6,742.61). The sustainability of the forests for the supply of wild plant products is precarious.

It has had two dimensions: ex situ germ plasm preservation in zoos, aquaria and arboreta (and by extension, seed banks, tissue cultures and genomic libraries), and in situ species preservation in refugia, especially in megadiversity areas involving high levels of endemism. Increasingly, however, biodiversity conservation is being taken out of zoos and protected areas. It is recognised that biodiversity is important for the functioning of all ecosystems, and that excessive loss of biodiversity imposes real costs on resource users (Heywood, 1995). It is therefore interesting to consider the problem of biodiversity loss not just in refugia, but in managed ecosystems. These are ecosystems from which some species have been deleted in order to enhance the productivity of others. The problem of biodiversity conservation in such cases does not therefore involve preservation of all existing species. It involves maintenance of sufficient interspecific and intraspecific diversity to protect the productivity of the system. Put another way, the problem of biodiversity conservation in managed systems requires us to think about the optimal or efficient level of species deletion.

At a theoretical level, it has been argued that the loss of resilience in an ecological-economic system involves a change in its long-run productive potential, but no consideration has yet been given to the empirical investigation of this. This paper discusses an econometric approach to the problem, using the example of semi-arid rangelands. The long-run productive potential of the system is regarded as an unobserved state variable, change in which is irreversible or at least only slowly reversible. It is estimated by applying the extended (nonlinear) Kalman filter. The paper illustrates the approach using data from Botswana for the period 1965–1993. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters associated with the loss of resilience mechanism are non-zero. They indicate a small loss of resilience event at the end of the long drought in the 1980s. However, these parameters are very imprecisely estimated and are therefore statistically insignificant. We find that the sensitivity of the system to exogenous shocks varies with fluctuations in both economic and non-economic parameters. Contrary to what is usually thought to be the case, the sensitivity of the system to exogenous shocks is only weakly affected by variations in offtake prices, but is very strongly affected by variations in the cost of herd maintenance. This suggests that offtake prices may be a weak tool for controlling the size of cattle stocks and preventing a loss of resilience. On the other hand, taxes on cattle stocks or grazing fees may be very effective.","|MA|","|","http://www.springerlink.com/content/q27lv89243k246j1/","DOI:10.1023/A:1008374222463","|",".  perrings c stern d i modelling loss of resilience in agroecosystems rangelands in botswana environmental and resource economics springer verlag gmbh economists have recently begun to consider the questions raised by the ecological concept of resilience – a measure of the degree to which a system can be perturbed before it switches from one stability domain to another at a theoretical level it has been argued that the loss of resilience in an ecological economic system involves a change in its long run productive potential but no consideration has yet been given to the empirical investigation of this this paper discusses an econometric approach to the problem using the example of semi arid rangelands the long run productive potential of the system is regarded as an unobserved state variable change in which is irreversible or at least only slowly reversible it is estimated by applying the extended nonlinear kalman filter the paper illustrates the approach using data from botswana for the period 1965–1993 the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters associated with the loss of resilience mechanism are non zero they indicate a small loss of resilience event at the end of the long drought in the 1980s however these parameters are very imprecisely estimated and are therefore statistically insignificant we find that the sensitivity of the system to exogenous shocks varies with fluctuations in both economic and non economic parameters contrary to what is usually thought to be the case the sensitivity of the system to exogenous shocks is only weakly affected by variations in offtake prices but is very strongly affected by variations in the cost of herd maintenance this suggests that offtake prices may be a weak tool for controlling the size of cattle stocks and preventing a loss of resilience on the other hand taxes on cattle stocks or grazing fees may be very effective http www springerlink com content q27lv89243k246j1  .",,

Both natural processes and human management have generated and sustained a vast array of genetic, species and ecological diversity. Within agricultural systems this agricultural biodiversity fulfils a number of important roles, including: • Providing food and livelihood security. Dynamic and complex rural livelihoods usually rely on plant and animal diversity, both wild and in different stages of domestication. Different types of agricultural biodiversity are used by different people at different times and in different places, and so contribute to livelihood strategies in a complex fashion. • Ensuring productive and environmental sustainability. In addition to contributing to environmental sustainability, agricultural biodiversity helps sustain many production functions both in low external input and high input-output agriculture. Available evidence is summarised for the following functions: soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, pollination, pest control, yield functions, soil and water conservation, action on climate and water cycling, biodiversity conservation and influence on landscape structure. • Supporting rural development. In addition to its contribution to food and livelihood security, agricultural biodiversity can provide the basis for ecotourism and the regeneration of localised food systems and rural economies. However, throughout the world the diversity of agroecosystems is being rapidly eroded. This erosion is due to a range of factors, including the neglect of indigenous knowledge, institutions and management systems; the blueprint approach to development whereby monoculture systems and uniform technologies are promoted; the quest of the transnational corporations that market agricultural inputs and process food and fibres for commercial profits and control over production; inequitable access to, and control over, land, water, trees and genetic resources on the part of local people; market pressures and the undervaluation of agricultural biodiversity; and demographic factors.<BR>The paper concludes with detailed actions urgently needed if this erosion of agricultural biodiversity is to be halted and reversed, and lists ways in which each of these actions can be achieved: • Expand knowledge on the dynamics of agricultural biodiversity • Increase effective use of agricultural biodiversity in food and fibre production • Promote local adaptive management of agricultural biodiversity • Support local participation in planning, management and evaluation • Transform bureaucracies and professional practice to take on new roles that facilitate local people’s analysis, planning, action, monitoring and evaluation • Strengthen local rights and security of tenure • Reform trade policies, markets and economic incentives.","|Ag|CG|","|","http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/6340IIED.pdf",,"|",".  pimbert m sustaining the multiple functions of agricultural biodiversity gatekeeper series no 88 iied london uk human communities worldwide have played a central role in shaping nature’s diversity and its associated functions both natural processes and human management have generated and sustained a vast array of genetic species and ecological diversity within agricultural systems this agricultural biodiversity fulfils a number of important roles including • providing food and livelihood security dynamic and complex rural livelihoods usually rely on plant and animal diversity both wild and in different stages of domestication different types of agricultural biodiversity are used by different people at different times and in different places and so contribute to livelihood strategies in a complex fashion • ensuring productive and environmental sustainability in addition to contributing to environmental sustainability agricultural biodiversity helps sustain many production functions both in low external input and high input output agriculture available evidence is summarised for the following functions soil organic matter decomposition nutrient cycling pollination pest control yield functions soil and water conservation action on climate and water cycling biodiversity conservation and influence on landscape structure • supporting rural development in addition to its contribution to food and livelihood security agricultural biodiversity can provide the basis for ecotourism and the regeneration of localised food systems and rural economies however throughout the world the diversity of agroecosystems is being rapidly eroded this erosion is due to a range of factors including the neglect of indigenous knowledge institutions and management systems; the blueprint approach to development whereby monoculture systems and uniform technologies are promoted; the quest of the transnational corporations that market agricultural inputs and process food and fibres for commercial profits and control over production; inequitable access to and control over land water trees and genetic resources on the part of local people; market pressures and the undervaluation of agricultural biodiversity; and demographic factors the paper concludes with detailed actions urgently needed if this erosion of agricultural biodiversity is to be halted and reversed and lists ways in which each of these actions can be achieved • expand knowledge on the dynamics of agricultural biodiversity • increase effective use of agricultural biodiversity in food and fibre production • promote local adaptive management of agricultural biodiversity • support local participation in planning management and evaluation • transform bureaucracies and professional practice to take on new roles that facilitate local people’s analysis planning action monitoring and evaluation • strengthen local rights and security of tenure • reform trade policies markets and economic incentives http pubs iied org pdfs 6340iied pdf  .",,

Establishing formal protected areas is one means of conserving habitat, but socio-economic and political constraints limit the amount of land in such status. Addressing conservation issues on lands outside of formal protected areas is also necessary. In this paper we develop a spatially explicit model for analyzing the consequences of alternative land-use patterns on the persistence of various species and on market-oriented economic returns. The biological model uses habitat preferences, habitat area requirements, and dispersal ability for each species to predict the probability of persistence of that species given a land-use pattern. The economic model uses characteristics of the land unit and location to predict the value of commodity production given a land-use pattern. We use the combined biological and economic model to search for efficient land-use patterns in which the conservation outcome cannot be improved without lowering the value of commodity production. We illustrate our methods with an example that includes three alternative land uses, managed forestry, agriculture, and biological reserve (protected area), for a modeled landscape whose physical, biological, and economic characteristics are based on conditions found in the Willamette Basin in Oregon (USA). We find that a large fraction of conservation objectives can be achieved at little cost to the economic bottom line with thoughtful land-use planning.

This is particularly true for Latin America where inequality and ethnicity are important aspects of poverty and sustainability. This paper is a detailed examination of the natural resources, socio-economic assets and livelihood strategies of two Mayan communities of the Mexican State of Yucatán. There were three fundamental objectives: to elucidate the people's perceptions of poverty, to analyse their resource use and livelihood strategies, and to suggest ways in which access to markets can reduce poverty and enhance sustainable development. Using qualitative and quantitative methodologies, the dominance of certain successful strategies are made clear. First, milpa - the traditional system of maize production - is a way of life for the Mayas. Secure access to maize-producing land is a valuable asset, partly because it also attracts government subsidies. Second, ownership of small livestock is also part of Mayan life. Ownership of other assets such as beehives gives access to (relatively) lucrative product markets. Third, active agribusiness marketing also requires assets: ownership of transport services; finance to assemble and sell products such as forest fruits, honey and maize; business skills and an ability to create commercial linkages to traders.

An upland forest-related community in northern central Vietnam, where the policy was introduced in 2002, was chosen as a case study. It was found that local residents in the community have not complied with the forest allocation policy well, in that they violated the policy to freely lend forestland to and borrow from villagers for cropping purposes, regardless of whether they were rich or poor, had enough land or not, or were legally forest recipients. Regarding forest dependency, all households studied lived on forest resources (forestland and forest products).

Yet, with rare exception, ecosystem services are neither prized by markets nor explicitly protected by the law. In recent years, an increasing number of initiatives around the world have sought to create markets for services, some dependent on government intervention and some created by entirely private ventures. These experiences have demonstrated that investing in natural capital rather than built capital can make both economic and policy sense. Informed by the author’s recent experiences establishing a market for water quality in Australia, this Article examines the challenges and opportunities of an ecosystem services approach to environmental protection. This Article reviews the range of current payment schemes and identifies the key requirements for instrument design.

However, this resource-poor mountain ecosystem is gradually becoming unable to provide a minimum standard of living to its continually growing population. In this ecosystem, human population is doubling every 27–30 years, against the declining resource base, particularly forests. Forest are disappearing both quantitatively and qualitatively. Against the requirement of 18 ha of forest land to maintain production in 1 ha of cultivated land, the ratio of forests to cultivated land is only 1.33: 1. The present production from grasslands supports 8 units of livestock, against the ideal 2 units, and the gap between the demand and deficit of fodder is more than 5-fold. Loss of vegetative cover is resulting in drying up of water resources, compelling the women to walk longer distances to collect water. This ecological deterioration, apart from human growth and interference, is compounded by mountain specificities such as inaccessibility, fragility, marginality, diversity, niche and adaptability. The specificities manifest in isolation, distance, poor communication, limited mobility, etc., resulting in limited external linkages and replication of external experiences, and slow pace of development. They, therefore, restrict options for economic growth, effecting poverty and affecting the quality of life of the people of the region. Poverty, in this mountain ecosystem cannot be understood and assessed independent of ecological wealth and would better be termed as ecological poverty. The development efforts to be effective in alleviating poverty here, should take into account mountain specificities and incorporate options which have larger human dimensions, such as mechanisms for population control, socio-economic and cultural conditioning, indigenous knowledge systems of the local people and simple technologies that are already in practice or have potential and are based on least external inputs.","|PE|","|142-062-356|","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504500309469794","DOI:10.1080/13504500309469794","|",".  samal p k palni l m s agrawal d k ecology ecological poverty and sustainable development in central himalayan region of india international journal of sustainable development & world ecology taylor & francis the people inhabiting the mountains of the central himalayan region of india are heavily dependent on their immediate natural resources for their survival however this resource poor mountain ecosystem is gradually becoming unable to provide a minimum standard of living to its continually growing population in this ecosystem human population is doubling every 27–30 years against the declining resource base particularly forests forest are disappearing both quantitatively and qualitatively against the requirement of 18 ha of forest land to maintain production in 1 ha of cultivated land the ratio of forests to cultivated land is only 1 33 1 the present production from grasslands supports 8 units of livestock against the ideal 2 units and the gap between the demand and deficit of fodder is more than 5 fold loss of vegetative cover is resulting in drying up of water resources compelling the women to walk longer distances to collect water this ecological deterioration apart from human growth and interference is compounded by mountain specificities such as inaccessibility fragility marginality diversity niche and adaptability the specificities manifest in isolation distance poor communication limited mobility etc resulting in limited external linkages and replication of external experiences and slow pace of development they therefore restrict options for economic growth effecting poverty and affecting the quality of life of the people of the region poverty in this mountain ecosystem cannot be understood and assessed independent of ecological wealth and would better be termed as ecological poverty the development efforts to be effective in alleviating poverty here should take into account mountain specificities and incorporate options which have larger human dimensions such as mechanisms for population control socio economic and cultural conditioning indigenous knowledge systems of the local people and simple technologies that are already in practice or have potential and are based on least external inputs http www tandfonline com doi abs 10 1080 13504500309469794  .",,

The cross-sectional analysis provides evidence in favor of the hypothesis that socio-economic inequalities within the group are inexorably associated with the ability of the households in resource use. In general, it is evident that household’s wealth status (coefficient for rich = -0.420; p = 0.019), proximity to the forest (coefficient for distance = -0.280; p = 0.083), forest visit (coefficient for frequent forest visit = +0.257; p = 0.066) exert a strong influence on appropriating fuel-wood from the forest. Above all, income status of households was found to be key determinant of household’s fuel-wood collection from the forest. Poor households were highly dependent on the forests for fuel-wood (average annual extraction = 4561.3 kg/household) in order to sustain their day-to-day livelihood. The high dependence of poor coupled with their large population size in the region (>27%) will possibly cause forest degradation in future. Therefore, policy must be directed towards reducing fuelwood dependency of poor households by lifting their economic status so that they can substitute fuel-wood in day-to-day use.

The subsistence nature of tobacco production in Tanzania suggests that most power-driven equipments, fertilizers and sustainable crop processing technologies are beyond the reach of most small-scale tobacco growers. The consequence is that in order to expand their production, tobacco farmers heavily substitute such inputs by an increasing use of wood. Hence, an increasing amount of forest land is cleared by the farmers resulting in forest degradation and a loss of biodiversity. This study determines in a first step the efficiency of tobacco production bordering the Miombo woodlands in Tanzania as well as investigates factors for the relative inefficiency on farm level. In a second step, the relation between forest species diversity in the surrounding woodlands and tobacco production efficiency as well as between diversity and the type of institutional arrangement with respect to forest management are empirically analysed. The results indicate that the different efficiency measures vary widely over the sample, showing a significant positive effect of the curing technology–i.e., the design of the barn–and the source of the firewood. The majority of farmers produce with increasing returns to scale. A strong positive correlation between the tobacco production efficiency and forest diversity as well as between community-based arrangements and forest diversity is revealed. This suggests that an increase in agricultural production efficiency with respect to tobacco is conducive for environmental sustainability in Tanzania.

The most commonly used such products are wild spinaches, fuelwood, wooden utensils edible fruits, grass hand-brushes, and twig hand-brushes, used by 85% or more of households. More than half the households investigated also make use of edible insects, wood for construction, bushmeat, wild honey and reeds for weaving. Individual households may exploit dozens of animal and plant species. The range in annual, direct-use values is large, from less than R1000 per household per year to over R12 000. The value to rural households is manifest through a daily net function which represents a cost saving to the families involved and to the state, as well as through an emergency net, which serves as an insurance in times of misfortune, such as drought, disease, and unexpected economic hardship. The emergency net function has hardly been quantified in South Africa and internationally. Ad hoc trade in NTFPs is a common emergency net, which in some instances evolves into a permanent way of life. Financial returns from trade are variable, depending on resource type and hours worked, but are typically low. Despite the small cash incomes from trade, they provide an important contribution that complement the diverse livelihood strategies within a household, especially for the poorer sectors of rural society.

The findings provide a mean or composite picture, averaged across the sample households within each community. Yet, within any given community, there is significant socio-economic differentiation. It is important to acknowledge such differentiation when considering policy and management interventions to support rural livelihoods and promote sustainable resource use. This paper reports on a study in South Africa, the objective of which was to explore wealth-related differences and similarities in the use and value of NTFPs.<BR>Data on NTFP consumption, purchase, and sale were collected from households in three rural villages. Households were divided into three wealth classes and patterns of NTFPs use between the classes examined. There was no difference in the proportions of households in each wealth class using NTFPs, nor the total number of NTFPs used per household. Yet, there was some supporting evidence that poorer households derive greater benefits from NTFPs than do wealthy or intermediate households. One clear difference was that, with increasing wealth, households purchased significantly more NTFPs, and a greater proportion of wealthy households did so. Conversely, a greater proportion of poor households were involved in the sale of one or more NTFPs, and they sold a greater number per household, compared to wealthy and intermediate households. Detailed examination of use and value of four NTFPs (fuelwood, wild fruits, edible herbs, and grass hand brushes) revealed that in all instances, the poorest households used more of the resource per capita than the other wealth classes. This was not the case for comparisons based on the total household as the unit of analysis. Gross annual direct-use value did not differ between the wealth classes for any of the four NTFPs examined, at the household level.

This paper considers the role of dry forest types, including savannas, using South Africa as a case example. It concludes that a large proportion of the population makes use of forests and the resources from them. These are vital components of local livelihoods, which probably prevent people from slipping into deeper poverty. Moreover, for a measurable proportion, engagement in informal forest activities, as well as the formal forestry sector, has resulted in them being able to move out of poverty. Additionally, the generally dry nature of forests in South Africa, coupled with the high unemployment rate, limit the extent of alternative locally based livelihood options, thereby magnifying the contributions from forests and forest products.

Although the literacy rate in the villages was quite high, due to lack of employment opportunities people still invariably depend on forests for their livelihood. In all the study villages more than 75% of fodder and fuelwood were extracted from the forest. The pressure exerted by human and bovine populations, coupled with unsustainable management policies, has resulted in the destruction of forest cover and ecological degradation. Agriculture (which is 70% rainfed in the Mandal area and 90% rainfed in Chaurangikhal) and employment as laborers were the main occupations of people in the study areas; in addition, remittance income (8.6% in the Mandal area and 21.3% in Chaurangikhal) and dairy faming accounted for a major portion of total household income. The study revealed a positive relationship between income and livestock population (0.995), which reveals the strong role of animal husbandry in the rural economy. The equally positive relationship between income and fodder consumption (0.930) can be attributed to extraction of large quantities of fodder to sustain dairy farming for commercial purposes.

In theory, the adoption of these methods can provide win–win solutions to tropical deforestation because they address the environmental consequences of deforestation while increasing the welfare of forest inhabitants. However, there is little reliable data that can be used to test this hypothesis since many of the goods produced in sustainable systems do not have well-defined markets and are most often consumed at home. This paper examines the benefits of collecting and harvesting non-timber forest products in the tropics through various methods using household panel data collected in 1996 and 2000 in the Ouro Preto do Oeste region of Rondônia, Brazil. We estimate the use-value of land under forest, agriculture, and pasture and complement these estimations with census data and regression analysis. Our estimations reveal that households utilizing sustainable practices in the forms of agroforestry and the collection of non-timber forest products have significantly higher levels of diversification. We conclude that directing policy towards “win–win” strategies may not be desirable for reducing both poverty and deforestation in this region since we find no clear evidence that these can successfully be addressed simultaneously.

Empirical analysis of resource use transition among the Huaorani People of the Ecuadorian Amazon shows that as markets become more accessible production patterns change but do not seem to affect subsistence production. Huaoranis increase the production of animal resources from forests. However, the extraction of harvested and primarily of farmed commodities seems not to be affected. Data also suggest that trade relies on limited specialization. Trade among the Huaorani communities studied depends on raising the production of some of the same commodities that are found in the subsistence basket. These changes are clearly explained if a flexible-labor theory of early market integration is used. This period is characterized by labor and land abundance and a relative ease to move labor from low return to more productive activities. Under these conditions, market participation need not be accompanied by a reduction in the production of subsistence commodities or commodity specialization. High risks and uncertainty and high transportation costs keep poor forest households from shifting completely to commercial activities. This contrasts with a long presumption that production of individual commodities responds quickly to price changes, based on demand shifts between products, but that total output is slow to respond. Only after all the surplus labor has been allocated to productive activities total output becomes less flexible. At this point increased production requires commodity or technological specialization.","|Fo|MA|CS|","|019-005-218|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800998001013","doi:10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00101-3","|",".  sierra r rodriguez f losos e forest resource use change during early market integration in tropical rain forests the huaorani of upper amazonia ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk this paper examines the impact of early market integration on the extraction of forest resources by traditional forest based households with emphasis on the commercial subsistence dichotomy empirical analysis of resource use transition among the huaorani people of the ecuadorian amazon shows that as markets become more accessible production patterns change but do not seem to affect subsistence production huaoranis increase the production of animal resources from forests however the extraction of harvested and primarily of farmed commodities seems not to be affected data also suggest that trade relies on limited specialization trade among the huaorani communities studied depends on raising the production of some of the same commodities that are found in the subsistence basket these changes are clearly explained if a flexible labor theory of early market integration is used this period is characterized by labor and land abundance and a relative ease to move labor from low return to more productive activities under these conditions market participation need not be accompanied by a reduction in the production of subsistence commodities or commodity specialization high risks and uncertainty and high transportation costs keep poor forest households from shifting completely to commercial activities this contrasts with a long presumption that production of individual commodities responds quickly to price changes based on demand shifts between products but that total output is slow to respond only after all the surplus labor has been allocated to productive activities total output becomes less flexible at this point increased production requires commodity or technological specialization http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800998001013  .",,

Much of the wheat area in Punjab was already planted with earlier products of modern plant breeding programs when the Green Revolution began. These cultivars were more genetically similar and less productive than the semi-dwarf wheat varieties that succeeded them. We define, summarize and test indices of variety change and genetic diversity for the modern wheat varieties released and grown in Indian Punjab during the post-Green Revolution period. The first is the area-weighted average of varieties grown, which measures the rate of variety change, important means of counteracting the uniformity that can lead to pathogen mutation and plant diseases. Variety change is determined in large part by variety release and seed industry po licies. The second is the average coefficient of diversity, which measures the extent of dissimilarity among wheat varieties conferred through plant breeding. A generalized Cobb-Douglas production function is estimated with these indices specified as technical efficiency parameters, after testing for the exogeneity of each index. Findings support the hypothesis that slow variety age has counteracted the positive productivity effects brought about through diversifying the genetic base in wheat breeding in the post-Green Revolution period.

The country’s humid tropical forests, among the most extensive remaining in the world, are primarily in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya. A devastating regional economic crisis that began in mid-1997 affected Indonesia more strongly than any other country in Asia. A random sample survey of 1,050 households was conducted in six outer island provinces to understand the effects of the crisis on the wellbeing of forest villagers and on their agricultural and forest clearing practices. In particular, the study sought to understand diverging opportunities introduced by the drastic depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah against the U.S. dollar: on one hand producers of agro-export commodities could get an income windfall from higher market prices; on the other hand increased costs of living could neutralise potential income gains. Among the key findings of the research are: (1) two-thirds of the study households reported they were worse off and only one-fifth reported they were better off during the crisis than in the year before the crisis; (2) this happened in spite of the fact that three-quarters of study households had export commodity income; (3) clearing of forest land increased slightly in the first year of the crisis and greatly in the second year of the crisis; (4) land was cleared increasingly for export tree crops in sedentary systems and less for food crops in swidden cultivation systems; and (5) those who perceived themselves as worse off or better off were more likely to have cleared land during the crisis, and to have cleared a larger area of land, than those who felt their wellbeing did not change significantly. Contrary to the common assumption that rural Indonesians were generally unaffected by the crisis, forest villagers perceived themselves as worse off during the crisis than before. Moreover, additional pressure has been put on forests, in spite of any conclusions that might be drawn from the turn toward increased sedentary farming during the crisis. Key policy lessons are that: (1) farmers need assistance in diversifying their income sources to help protect them against possible future economic shocks; and (2) there should be greater awareness of how macroeconomic instability can lead to undesirable environmental consequences.","|Ag|PE|CS|","|142-035-360|","http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.75.3474&rep=rep1&type=pdf",,"|",".  sunderlin w d resosudarmo i a p the effect of indonesia’s economic crisis on small farmers and natural forest cover in the outer islands cifor occasional paper 28 1 cifor bogor indonesia twenty million people live in or near indonesia’s natural forests the country’s humid tropical forests among the most extensive remaining in the world are primarily in sumatra kalimantan sulawesi and irian jaya a devastating regional economic crisis that began in mid 1997 affected indonesia more strongly than any other country in asia a random sample survey of 1 050 households was conducted in six outer island provinces to understand the effects of the crisis on the wellbeing of forest villagers and on their agricultural and forest clearing practices in particular the study sought to understand diverging opportunities introduced by the drastic depreciation of the indonesian rupiah against the u s dollar on one hand producers of agro export commodities could get an income windfall from higher market prices; on the other hand increased costs of living could neutralise potential income gains among the key findings of the research are 1 two thirds of the study households reported they were worse off and only one fifth reported they were better off during the crisis than in the year before the crisis; 2 this happened in spite of the fact that three quarters of study households had export commodity income; 3 clearing of forest land increased slightly in the first year of the crisis and greatly in the second year of the crisis; 4 land was cleared increasingly for export tree crops in sedentary systems and less for food crops in swidden cultivation systems; and 5 those who perceived themselves as worse off or better off were more likely to have cleared land during the crisis and to have cleared a larger area of land than those who felt their wellbeing did not change significantly contrary to the common assumption that rural indonesians were generally unaffected by the crisis forest villagers perceived themselves as worse off during the crisis than before moreover additional pressure has been put on forests in spite of any conclusions that might be drawn from the turn toward increased sedentary farming during the crisis key policy lessons are that 1 farmers need assistance in diversifying their income sources to help protect them against possible future economic shocks; and 2 there should be greater awareness of how macroeconomic instability can lead to undesirable environmental consequences http citeseerx ist psu edu viewdoc download doi=10 1 1 75 3474&rep=rep1&type=pdf  .",,

The abstraction level aimed for, however, may be too high to yield meaningful results. Many of the experiments on which evidence in favour or otherwise are based are artificial and do not support the bold generalisations to other spatial and temporal scales that are often made. Future investigations should utilise co-evolved communities, be structured to investigate the distinct roles of clearly defined functional groups, separate the effects of between- and within-group diversity and be conducted over a range of stress and disturbance situations. An integral part of agricultural intensification at the plot level is the deliberate reduction of diversity. This does not necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services of direct relevance to the land user unless the hypothesised diversity–function threshold is breached by elimination of a key functional group or species. Key functions may also be substituted with petro-chemical energy in order to achieve perceived efficiencies in the production of specific goods. This can result in the maintenance of ecosystem services of importance to agricultural production at levels of biodiversity below the assumed ‘functional threshold’. However, it can also result in impairment of other services and under some conditions the de-linking of the diversity–function relationship. Avoidance of these effects or attempts to restore non-essential ecosystem services are only likely to be made by land users at the plot scale if direct economic benefit can be thereby achieved. At the plot and farm scales biodiversity is unlikely to be maintained for purposes other than those of direct use or ‘utilitarian’ benefits and often at levels lower than those necessary for maintenance of many ecosystem services. The exceptions may be traditional systems where intrinsic values (social customs) continue to provide reasons for diversity maintenance. High levels of biodiversity in managed landscapes are more likely to be maintained for reasons of intrinsic, serependic (‘option’ or ‘bequest’) values or utilitarian (‘direct use’) than for functional or ecosystem service values. The major opportunity for both maintaining ecosystem services and biodiversity outside conservation areas lies in promoting diversity of land-use at the landscape and farm rather than field scale. This requires, however, an economic and policy climate that favours diversification in land uses and diversity among land users.","|Ag|CG|","|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904000362","doi:10.1016/j.agee.2004.01.013","|",".  swift m j izac a m n van noordwijk m biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes—are we asking the right questions agriculture ecosystems and the environment elsevier science ltd uk the assumed relationship between biodiversity or local richness and the persistence of ‘ecosystem services’ that can sustain productivity on site as well as off site e g through regulation of water flow and storage in agricultural landscapes has generated considerable interest and a range of experimental approaches the abstraction level aimed for however may be too high to yield meaningful results many of the experiments on which evidence in favour or otherwise are based are artificial and do not support the bold generalisations to other spatial and temporal scales that are often made future investigations should utilise co evolved communities be structured to investigate the distinct roles of clearly defined functional groups separate the effects of between and within group diversity and be conducted over a range of stress and disturbance situations an integral part of agricultural intensification at the plot level is the deliberate reduction of diversity this does not necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services of direct relevance to the land user unless the hypothesised diversity–function threshold is breached by elimination of a key functional group or species key functions may also be substituted with petro chemical energy in order to achieve perceived efficiencies in the production of specific goods this can result in the maintenance of ecosystem services of importance to agricultural production at levels of biodiversity below the assumed ‘functional threshold’ however it can also result in impairment of other services and under some conditions the de linking of the diversity–function relationship avoidance of these effects or attempts to restore non essential ecosystem services are only likely to be made by land users at the plot scale if direct economic benefit can be thereby achieved at the plot and farm scales biodiversity is unlikely to be maintained for purposes other than those of direct use or ‘utilitarian’ benefits and often at levels lower than those necessary for maintenance of many ecosystem services the exceptions may be traditional systems where intrinsic values social customs continue to provide reasons for diversity maintenance high levels of biodiversity in managed landscapes are more likely to be maintained for reasons of intrinsic serependic ‘option’ or ‘bequest’ values or utilitarian ‘direct use’ than for functional or ecosystem service values the major opportunity for both maintaining ecosystem services and biodiversity outside conservation areas lies in promoting diversity of land use at the landscape and farm rather than field scale this requires however an economic and policy climate that favours diversification in land uses and diversity among land users http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0167880904000362  .",,

The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year—to—year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non—drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable.

In India over 50 million people are believed to be directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain ecological cost (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing ‘win-lose’ settings have to be steered to a ‘win-win’ mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods (‘lose-lose’). Examining the dependence of forest fringe communities on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the ecological cost of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined.

Through destruction or distress sales of productive assets, a hurricane or another natural hazard could induce people with relatively remunerative livelihoods to choose more defensive strategies which allow them to survive, but at a permanently lower welfare level than before. Using panel data from before and after hurricane Mitch, we find that livelihood strategies can be grouped into three welfare categories. Annual farming and farm employment generate low incomes, whereas nonfarm wage employment and livestock farming result in relatively high incomes. Perennial farming, nonfarm self-employment and annual cropping with nonfarm employment take an intermediate position. High welfare strategies were associated with high levels of capital, and the number of people involved was very similar between different years, suggesting that households following low-welfare strategies were trapped in poverty. However, many households moved actively between strategies of different welfare levels. This indicates that there was no absolute poverty threshold, but also that being able to initiate a relatively profitable livelihood strategy was no guarantee that this strategy could be maintained. There is no evidence that hurricane Mitch affected livelihood strategy transitions: livelihood mobility was similar for households inside and outside Mitch-affected areas.","|PE|CS|","|019-013-558|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800909003930","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.09.006","|",".  household income strategies and natural disasters dynamic livelihoods in rural nicaragua ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk this paper assesses the impact of hurricane mitch on livelihood strategies of rural households in nicaragua through destruction or distress sales of productive assets a hurricane or another natural hazard could induce people with relatively remunerative livelihoods to choose more defensive strategies which allow them to survive but at a permanently lower welfare level than before using panel data from before and after hurricane mitch we find that livelihood strategies can be grouped into three welfare categories annual farming and farm employment generate low incomes whereas nonfarm wage employment and livestock farming result in relatively high incomes perennial farming nonfarm self employment and annual cropping with nonfarm employment take an intermediate position high welfare strategies were associated with high levels of capital and the number of people involved was very similar between different years suggesting that households following low welfare strategies were trapped in poverty however many households moved actively between strategies of different welfare levels this indicates that there was no absolute poverty threshold but also that being able to initiate a relatively profitable livelihood strategy was no guarantee that this strategy could be maintained there is no evidence that hurricane mitch affected livelihood strategy transitions livelihood mobility was similar for households inside and outside mitch affected areas http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800909003930  .",,

Kobugabe-Berg. Washington, D.C.","Environmental income is defined as rent (or value added) captured through consumption, barter, or sale of natural capital within the first link in a market chain, starting from the point at which the natural capital is extracted or appropriated. The present study, which focuses on forest environmental income, had two main objectives. The first was to investigate the extent to which people in rural areas of developing countries depend on income from forest environmental resources, and how this dependence is conditioned by different political, economic, ecological, and socio-cultural factors. This is accomplished by a meta-analysis of 54 case studies. The second objective was to review research methodology and make recommendations for “best practices” in assessment of forest environmental income. Although there are substantial variations in methodology and quality of case studies, results indicate that forest environmental income represents a significant income source with an average contribution to household income of some 22 percent in the populations sampled. The main sources of forest environmental incomes are fuelwood, wild foods, and fodder for animals. Forest environmental income has a strong and significant equalizing effect on local income distribution. Cash income constitutes about half of total forest environmental income. The report recommends the development of research protocols, field methods, and simple analytical models to analyze the role of environmental income in rural livelihoods. More in-depth studies are needed to unravel the roles of local heterogeneity and social differentiation. Extended studies that generate time series data would assist in understanding the role of environmental income in both individual household strategies and in broader development strategies. The omission of forest environmental income in national statistics and in poverty assessments leads to an underestimation of rural incomes, and a lack of appreciation of the value of environment. In areas where environmental income is important, this omission may also lead to flawed policies and interventions.","|PE|","|","http://www.rmportal.net/training/poverty-reduction-seminar/seminar-reading-list-1/countingontheenvironmentforestincomesandtheruralpoor.pdf",,"|",".  vedeld p angelsen a sjaastad e kobugabe berg g counting on the environment forest incomes and the rural poor world bank e sjaastad and g kobugabe berg washington d c environmental income is defined as rent or value added captured through consumption barter or sale of natural capital within the first link in a market chain starting from the point at which the natural capital is extracted or appropriated the present study which focuses on forest environmental income had two main objectives the first was to investigate the extent to which people in rural areas of developing countries depend on income from forest environmental resources and how this dependence is conditioned by different political economic ecological and socio cultural factors this is accomplished by a meta analysis of 54 case studies the second objective was to review research methodology and make recommendations for “best practices” in assessment of forest environmental income although there are substantial variations in methodology and quality of case studies results indicate that forest environmental income represents a significant income source with an average contribution to household income of some 22 percent in the populations sampled the main sources of forest environmental incomes are fuelwood wild foods and fodder for animals forest environmental income has a strong and significant equalizing effect on local income distribution cash income constitutes about half of total forest environmental income the report recommends the development of research protocols field methods and simple analytical models to analyze the role of environmental income in rural livelihoods more in depth studies are needed to unravel the roles of local heterogeneity and social differentiation extended studies that generate time series data would assist in understanding the role of environmental income in both individual household strategies and in broader development strategies the omission of forest environmental income in national statistics and in poverty assessments leads to an underestimation of rural incomes and a lack of appreciation of the value of environment in areas where environmental income is important this omission may also lead to flawed policies and interventions http www rmportal net training poverty reduction seminar seminar reading list 1 countingontheenvironmentforestincomesandtheruralpoor pdf  .",,

The commercial collection of these products could reduce both the number of species and population of a species in the forests. In order to keep the balance between biodiversity and commercial collection of NTFPs, this paper evaluates the dependence of forest dwellers on NTFPs and identifies the relation between household characteristics and cash income generated by NTFP collection. As a result, commercial collection of NTFPs is negatively correlated to dependency ratio, poverty level and distance to the provincial city, and positively correlated with female labors of households. Moreover, NTFPs are proved to be very important in poor households or in those who lack rice or high rate of female labor. The households who have higher dependency ratio benefit less from NTFPs sold, while those who lack rice for their own consumption or have a higher rate of female labor depend more on NTFPs. Poor households are more dependent on NTFP collection than other groups. Finally, the result of this study highly recommends that the Government of Vietnam be aware of gender balance, distance to provincial city, poverty level and dependency ratio when applying a policy related to NTFP conservation. An appropriate incentive policy for woman and poor households might be a possible solution for less commercial collection of NTFPs. The poor households who have low dependency ratio or high female labor rate should be encouraged to participate in the forest management system to control the balance between commercial collection of NTFP and conservation.","|Fo|PE|CS|","|142-035-704|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800906001406","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.03.010","|",".  viet quang d nam anh t commercial collection of ntfps and households living in or near the forests case study in que con cuong and ma tuong duong nghe an vietnam ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk in vietnam ntfps has become an important source of cash income for local people living in or near the forests the commercial collection of these products could reduce both the number of species and population of a species in the forests in order to keep the balance between biodiversity and commercial collection of ntfps this paper evaluates the dependence of forest dwellers on ntfps and identifies the relation between household characteristics and cash income generated by ntfp collection as a result commercial collection of ntfps is negatively correlated to dependency ratio poverty level and distance to the provincial city and positively correlated with female labors of households moreover ntfps are proved to be very important in poor households or in those who lack rice or high rate of female labor the households who have higher dependency ratio benefit less from ntfps sold while those who lack rice for their own consumption or have a higher rate of female labor depend more on ntfps poor households are more dependent on ntfp collection than other groups finally the result of this study highly recommends that the government of vietnam be aware of gender balance distance to provincial city poverty level and dependency ratio when applying a policy related to ntfp conservation an appropriate incentive policy for woman and poor households might be a possible solution for less commercial collection of ntfps the poor households who have low dependency ratio or high female labor rate should be encouraged to participate in the forest management system to control the balance between commercial collection of ntfp and conservation http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800906001406  .",,

Parks have considerable resources and expertise which they can use to support local development through ICDPs, although it would be unrealistic to expect parks to solve widespread rural poverty amongst their neighbours.

We believe that conservation is unsustainable if it undermines basic human needs, and our mission statement pledges that our work will ‘…take account of human needs’. FFI endeavours to ensure that its conservation activities do not disadvantage or undermine poor, vulnerable or marginalised people who are dependent upon or live adjacent to natural resources, and wherever possible seeks to conserve biodiversity in ways that enhance their wellbeing. Thus, we work to identify and mitigate the potential social impacts of conservation actions and develop incentives for biodiversity to be conserved in the long term, demonstrating that good conservation can sustain local economies, retaining both economic and cultural options for impoverished people.  FFI founded its Biodiversity and Human Needs thematic programme in 2004, funded predominantly by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS) and more recently by Anglo American Plc. The programme enables FFI to analyse how and why we are addressing human needs in our conservation work; to plan interventions more strategically; to improve our monitoring and analysis of projects, and to develop good practice to ensure that FFI achieves its mission effectively and universally. To date, the programme has also directly supported over 30 of FFI’s field projects in 22 countries, helping them to improve planning and implementation and to document lessons.  Nine case studies are presented here, documenting our experiences, from improving agricultural productivity to reduce pressure on natural habitat in Cambodia, Belize and Brazil, to helping communities get involved in the governance of local protected areas in Tanzania and Vietnam, to developing micro-enterprises in Kyrgyzstan and South Africa, and influencing international policy.  These projects supported by the programme were all at different stages of development and for some it is still too early to assess impacts, but there are ample lessons to be learnt from the activities and outcomes. The diverse lessons learnt are summarised below, in the interests of promoting good practice for conservation and human wellbeing. The lessons also refer to a series of Briefing Notes developed by the Biodiversity and Human Needs team, which cover various aspects of addressing livelihoods in the conservation context.","|PE|","|","http://www.fauna-flora.org/wp-content/uploads/Compendium-of-case-studies-lessons-recommendations.pdf",,"|",".  wilder l linking biodiversity conservation & human needs a compendium of case studies lessons & recommendations flora and fauna international cambridge fauna & flora international ffi is an international conservation organisation that recognises that poverty and conservation are often intertwined and that there are ethical and strategic arguments for addressing human needs we believe that conservation is unsustainable if it undermines basic human needs and our mission statement pledges that our work will ‘…take account of human needs’ ffi endeavours to ensure that its conservation activities do not disadvantage or undermine poor vulnerable or marginalised people who are dependent upon or live adjacent to natural resources and wherever possible seeks to conserve biodiversity in ways that enhance their wellbeing thus we work to identify and mitigate the potential social impacts of conservation actions and develop incentives for biodiversity to be conserved in the long term demonstrating that good conservation can sustain local economies retaining both economic and cultural options for impoverished people ffi founded its biodiversity and human needs thematic programme in 2004 funded predominantly by the dutch ministry of foreign affairs dgis and more recently by anglo american plc the programme enables ffi to analyse how and why we are addressing human needs in our conservation work; to plan interventions more strategically; to improve our monitoring and analysis of projects and to develop good practice to ensure that ffi achieves its mission effectively and universally to date the programme has also directly supported over 30 of ffi’s field projects in 22 countries helping them to improve planning and implementation and to document lessons nine case studies are presented here documenting our experiences from improving agricultural productivity to reduce pressure on natural habitat in cambodia belize and brazil to helping communities get involved in the governance of local protected areas in tanzania and vietnam to developing micro enterprises in kyrgyzstan and south africa and influencing international policy these projects supported by the programme were all at different stages of development and for some it is still too early to assess impacts but there are ample lessons to be learnt from the activities and outcomes the diverse lessons learnt are summarised below in the interests of promoting good practice for conservation and human wellbeing the lessons also refer to a series of briefing notes developed by the biodiversity and human needs team which cover various aspects of addressing livelihoods in the conservation context http www fauna flora org wp content uploads compendium of case studies lessons recommendations pdf  .",,

Catch rates were higher near the reserve (by a factor of 1.1 to 2.0), but fishing effort was often lowest there. Higher catch rates near the reserve were more likely due to spillover than to low fishing intensity. Lower fishing effort near the reserve may have been due to 1) weather patterns, 2) traditional importance of other fishing grounds, 3) high variability in catch rates, 4) lower market value of target species, and 5) social pressures. The yield taken near the reserve was only 10% of the total yield, but the actual spillover contribution was probably much less than this.

The Conference of Parties of the CBD initiated work on five thematic work programmes, including marine and coastal biodiversity. The oceans cover 70 per cent of the planet’s surface area and marine and coastal environments contain diverse habitats that support an abundance of marine life. Examples of marine and coastal communities include mangroves, coral reefs, sea grasses, algae, pelagic or open-ocean communities and deep-sea communities. A large percentage of the global community is directly or indirectly dependent on coastal zones for their livelihood. In view of their common concern for the conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal biodiversity, the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity agreed on a programme of action for marine issues, focusing on integrated marine and coastal area management, the sustainable use of living resources, protected areas, mariculture and alien species. Integrated marine and coastal area management approaches (such as IMCAM, ICM and ICZM) are recognised as the most effective tools for implementing the CBD with respect to the conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal biodiversity. In spite of this common agreement, it is still a challenge to find the right balance between biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of its components. The relevance and applicability of existing IMCAM instruments for the implementation of the Convention has not been clarified. Existing IMCAM guidance documents and IMCAM practices often fail to take biodiversity considerations fully into account.

We begin by discussing the policy context within which PES programs find themselves, highlighting other possible interventions to help preserve environmental amenities in Mexico. We then discuss some basic principles of environmental payment schemes, formalizing these into three that we simulate: payment of the opportunity cost for forests at risks; payment for environmental benefits provided by forests at risk; a flat payment scheme with a cap on allowable hectares, similar to the type of program often applied in developing countries; and a program of opportunity cost payments for forest at risk with highest environmental benefit per dollar paid. We find that, of these three, the last is most efficient and the second most egalitarian.

Over the past 50 years, approximately one-third of the world's mangrove forests have been lost, but most data show very variable loss rates and there is considerable margin of error in most estimates. Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource, being important nursery grounds and breeding sites for birds, fish, crustaceans, shellfish, reptiles and mammals; a renewable source of wood; accumulation sites for sediment, contaminants, carbon and nutrients; and offer protection against coastal erosion. The destruction of mangroves is usually positively related to human population density. Major reasons for destruction are urban development, aquaculture, mining and overexploitation for timber, fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Over the next 25 years, unrestricted clear felling, aquaculture, and overexploitation of fisheries will be the greatest threats, with lesser problems being alteration of hydrology, pollution and global warming. Loss of biodiversity is, and will continue to be, a severe problem as even pristine mangroves are species-poor compared with other tropical ecosystems. The future is not entirely bleak. The number of rehabilitation and restoration projects is increasing worldwide with some countries showing increases in mangrove area. The intensity of coastal aquaculture appears to have levelled off in some parts of the world. Some commercial projects and economic models indicate that mangroves can be used as a sustainable resource, especially for wood. The brightest note is that the rate of population growth is projected to slow during the next 50 years, with a gradual decline thereafter to the end of the century. Mangrove forests will continue to be exploited at current rates to 2025, unless they are seen as a valuable resource to be managed on a sustainable basis. After 2025, the future of mangroves will depend on technological and ecological advances in multi-species silviculture, genetics, and forestry modelling, but the greatest hope for their future is for a reduction in human population growth.","|CG|PE|","|","http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=130175","DOI:10.1017/S0376892902000231","|",".  alongi d m present state and future of the world s mangrove forests environmental conservation cambridge univ press mangroves the only woody halophytes living at the confluence of land and sea have been heavily used traditionally for food timber fuel and medicine and presently occupy about 181 000 km2 of tropical and subtropical coastline over the past 50 years approximately one third of the world s mangrove forests have been lost but most data show very variable loss rates and there is considerable margin of error in most estimates mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource being important nursery grounds and breeding sites for birds fish crustaceans shellfish reptiles and mammals; a renewable source of wood; accumulation sites for sediment contaminants carbon and nutrients; and offer protection against coastal erosion the destruction of mangroves is usually positively related to human population density major reasons for destruction are urban development aquaculture mining and overexploitation for timber fish crustaceans and shellfish over the next 25 years unrestricted clear felling aquaculture and overexploitation of fisheries will be the greatest threats with lesser problems being alteration of hydrology pollution and global warming loss of biodiversity is and will continue to be a severe problem as even pristine mangroves are species poor compared with other tropical ecosystems the future is not entirely bleak the number of rehabilitation and restoration projects is increasing worldwide with some countries showing increases in mangrove area the intensity of coastal aquaculture appears to have levelled off in some parts of the world some commercial projects and economic models indicate that mangroves can be used as a sustainable resource especially for wood the brightest note is that the rate of population growth is projected to slow during the next 50 years with a gradual decline thereafter to the end of the century mangrove forests will continue to be exploited at current rates to 2025 unless they are seen as a valuable resource to be managed on a sustainable basis after 2025 the future of mangroves will depend on technological and ecological advances in multi species silviculture genetics and forestry modelling but the greatest hope for their future is for a reduction in human population growth http journals cambridge org action displayabstract frompage=online&aid=130175  .",,

Twelve villages located within 3 km from the reserve boundary were chosen and 2–3% of the households interviewed with regard to their attitudes towards these three facets of conservation, their household resource use patterns, wealth, sex, age and length of residency. We found significant associations between wealth, sex, age and both tiger and forest conservation. Providing benefits has not changed the underlying attitudes of the communities. The poorer sections of society, whether receiving benefits or not, tended to support tiger conservation because conserving wildlife did not affect their livelihood in any way, whereas both the rich and poor had misgivings about forest conservation due to dependency on forest products.

First, despite commercial constraints, much can be done to enhance the contribution of tourism to poverty reduction, and a 'PPT' perspective assists in this endeavour. Secondly, PPT strategies can, and should be, incorporated by all actors in tourism, whether in government or business, at local or policy level. Thirdly, a wide range of impacts on poor people, going well beyond jobs, need to be recognised and enhanced.

Such a focus raises several practical issues during implementation. We review and translate key aspects of the economic theory of incentives into the context of performance payments schemes with special attention paid to two practical issues. The first is that of structuring individual incentives to account for risks outside the individual’s control such as weather that can affect the level of environmental services generated. The second deals with the possibility of distortion in the measurements of environmental services used to determine individual payments under PES schemes.

In the context of the EU 2010 goal of halting biodiversity loss, researchers have been called upon to evaluate the role of economic instruments for cost-effective decision-making, as well as non-market methods to assess their benefits. We argue that cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and non-market valuation (NMV) methods are necessary, but not sufficient, approaches to assessing the role of economic instruments in a policy mix. We review the principles of “social-ecological-systems”(SES) (Ostrom et al. 2007) and discuss how SES can complement economic cost and benefit assessment methods, in particular in policy design research. To illustrate our conceptual comparison of assessment methodologies, we look at two examples of economic instruments at different government levels – payments for ecosystem services (PES) at farm level and ecological fiscal transfers to municipal /county government. What conceptual problems are introduced when evaluating policies in an instrument mix? How can the SES framework complement CEA and NMV in policy assessment and design?

A dynamic optimal control problem approach is used to derive a recursive model consisting of forest loss, cocoa land, maize land and timber production equations. The first equation being a function of the last three, whilst the last three are functions of mainly prices. A piecewise regression approach is used to distinguish between the influence of the post from the pre-adjustment impacts. The overall results show that the post-adjustment period has had a reduced impact on the rate of forest loss. Specifically, cocoa land and more importantly timber production, but not maize land, are the significant proximate factors in forest loss in Ghana. There is a significant difference in the impacts in the pre and post-adjustment periods. For cocoa land, there is a positive influence of land expansion on forest loss in the pre-adjustment period. In the post-adjustment period, a one percent increase in land expansion led to about 0.2% fall in the rate of forest lost. For timber production a one percent increase led to about 0.2% increase and a fall of about 2.4% in the rate of forest lost in the pre and post-adjustment period respectively. The negative impact of timber in the post-adjustment period was however not very significant.

Fish diversity in mangroves varies at global, latitudinal, regional, local and habitat scales, and species composition in any one system represents the combined influences of factors operating at each of these scales. Mangrove dependence paradigms require critical evaluation as new data become available and as catches and mangrove areas decline. Although it is a widely held dogma that mangroves are essential for fish populations, most evidence is circumstantial.

This paper reviews literature on the recovery of restored mangrove ecosystems using relevant functional indicators. While stand structure in mangrove stands is dependent on age, site conditions and silvicultural management, published data indicates that stem densities are higher in restored mangroves than comparable natural stands; the converse is true for basal area. Biomass increment rates have been found to be higher in younger stands than older stands (e.g. 12 t ha&#8722;1 year&#8722;1 for a 12 years plantation compared to 5.1 t ha&#8722;1 year&#8722;1 for a 80-year-old plantation). Disparities in patterns of tree species recruitment into the restored stands have been observed with some stands having linear recruitment rates with time (hence enhancing stand complexity), while some older stands completely lacked the understorey. Biodiversity assessments suggest that some fauna species are more responsive to mangrove degradation (e.g. herbivorous crabs and mollusks in general), and thus mangrove restoration encourages the return of such species, in some cases to levels equivalent to those in comparable natural stands.

Today reefs are coming under increasing pressures from human activities. Therefore, the human dimension of reef management must play an important role in reef management programmes that now emphasise stakeholder involvement, community participation, and cooperative management. This is especially important in countries where people depend on reefs for subsistence and commercial fisheries, shoreline protection, and tourism attractions and yet their behaviour often adversely affects the health of the reef ecosystems. Reef researchers, managers, and policy-makers recognise the importance of understanding not only the biophysical conditions that determine system structure and processes, but also the social and economic conditions, contexts, and motivations that are associated with their use. As a result, interest has grown among government, non-government, community and research organisations in guidelines on how to assess socioeconomic conditions and how to incorporate this information into reef management programmes. The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) aims to provide critical information and data on both the biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of coral reefs now and into the future. This socioeconomic manual, which was developed to parallel the existing biophysical manual (English et al. 1997), is intended for use by coral reef managers directly working on reef management around the world to assist them with basic socioeconomic assessments in their communities. The audience is the manager who does not have formal social-science training and may use English as a second or third language. Implementation of this manual should be accompanied by training and guidance in how to conduct socioeconomic assessments. We are pleased to recommend this manual to you as an excellent guide in assessing people who use and affect coral reefs. Hopefully with its use, there will be greater appreciation of how people interact with coral reefs and improved management of their activities to ensure that these marvellous ecosystems will continue to provide sustainable services for communities into the future.","|CG|","|","http://www.socmon.org/pdf/GCRMN_Manual.pdf",,"|",".  bunce l townsley p pomeroy r pollnac r socioeconomic manual for coral reef management gcrmn global coral reef management network iucn noaa australian institute of marine science australian institute of marine science coral reef management has focused traditionally on the biophysical aspects of coral reefs – the corals other benthos fishes and the physics and chemistry of surrounding waters today reefs are coming under increasing pressures from human activities therefore the human dimension of reef management must play an important role in reef management programmes that now emphasise stakeholder involvement community participation and cooperative management this is especially important in countries where people depend on reefs for subsistence and commercial fisheries shoreline protection and tourism attractions and yet their behaviour often adversely affects the health of the reef ecosystems reef researchers managers and policy makers recognise the importance of understanding not only the biophysical conditions that determine system structure and processes but also the social and economic conditions contexts and motivations that are associated with their use as a result interest has grown among government non government community and research organisations in guidelines on how to assess socioeconomic conditions and how to incorporate this information into reef management programmes the global coral reef monitoring network gcrmn aims to provide critical information and data on both the biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of coral reefs now and into the future this socioeconomic manual which was developed to parallel the existing biophysical manual english et al 1997 is intended for use by coral reef managers directly working on reef management around the world to assist them with basic socioeconomic assessments in their communities the audience is the manager who does not have formal social science training and may use english as a second or third language implementation of this manual should be accompanied by training and guidance in how to conduct socioeconomic assessments we are pleased to recommend this manual to you as an excellent guide in assessing people who use and affect coral reefs hopefully with its use there will be greater appreciation of how people interact with coral reefs and improved management of their activities to ensure that these marvellous ecosystems will continue to provide sustainable services for communities into the future http www socmon org pdf gcrmn_manual pdf  .",,

During the last two decades an outstanding tropical dry forest restoration process had taken place in the province of Guanacaste, Costa Rica, which has given us a unique opportunity to study how and why tropical dry forest regrowth occurs. The purpose of this paper is to undertake a retrospective analysis of the social dynamics of forest deforestation and restoration in Guanacaste from 1960 to 2005. Hence we investigate how structural drivers shape patterns of forest-cover change and examine how the role that Costa Rica's conservation policies had played in promoting forest restoration. Our study combined analyses of socioeconomic data and satellite images of forest cover. We showed that forest regrowth observed in Guanacaste after the 1980s was the result of multiple socioeconomic factors. Our results indicate that the degree of incentive provided by conservation policies such as Payment for Environmental Services are not enough to ensure that Guanacaste's forest will be protected against the potentially negative impacts of future socioeconomic changes.

First, we review various customary management strategies and draw parallels with Western fisheries management. Secondly, we examine customary resource management and conservation. We argue that, while resource conservation often appears to be an unintended by-product of other social processes, customary management can, in fact, conserve marine resources. In the third section, we examine the resilience of customary management institutions to socioeconomic transformations.

As part of these efforts, many projects attempt to manage sites containing populations of more than one threatened species. Evaluation of those multiple-species projects is essential to determine their success and cost effectiveness in the conservation of threatened species. In this paper, we report on the further development of the cost utility analysis (CUA) technique, previously tested on single-species programs, to the evaluation of multiple-species projects. The results of tests on six New Zealand projects show that cost utility analysis can determine the species conservation success and cost effectiveness of a range of different multiple-species projects. The four projects that manage a high proportion of the total population of a threatened species were the most successful in terms of improving the conservation status of species. The present value (PV) cost per unit of output for each project ranged from NZ$425,000 to more than NZ$19 million. This research finds no evidence for the proposition that multiple-species projects are more cost effective than single-species programs in the conservation of threatened species. Multiple-species projects may, however, have other outputs, such as advocacy and education, or ecosystem restoration that are included in their objectives and are, as yet, unmeasured.

The large-scale dynamical processes and ubiquity of livestock economies and cultures across the grasslands calls for an integrated ecosystem approach to conservation to make up the shortfall in protected-area coverage. Ranchers and pastoralists will be more inclined to adopt an integrated landscape approach to conservation if they also see the threats to wildlife and grassland ecosystems as affecting their livelihoods and way of life. We arranged a series of learning exchanges between African and American pastoralists, ranchers, scientists, and conservationists aimed at building the collaboration and consensus needed to conserve grasslands at a landscape level. There was broad agreement on the threat of land fragmentation to livelihoods, wildlife, and grasslands. The exchanges also identified weaknesses in prevailing public, private, and community modes of ownership in halting fragmentation.

However, a poor understanding of the social dimensions of rangeland use has limited their proper management and sustainable development, which represent major challenges for Nepal's resource managers. Institutional development is thought to be a viable solution to this problem and may ultimately lead to improved rangeland management in Nepal. Based on this hypothesis, a study was conduced in the Rasuwa district of northern Nepal to examine the effectiveness of institutional development at the local and national levels in mitigating the problems facing sustainable rangeland management by using an institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework. The information and data were mainly collected from different stakeholders, farmers, professionals and practitioners using a toolkit of participatory rural appraisal (PRA), workshops and literature review. It can be concluded from this case study that a number of institutional development efforts are needed to promote sustainable rangeland management in this region. First, local herders represent a repository of rich indigenous knowledge essential to sustaining sound rangeland management practices; hence, indigenous practices need to be integrated into modern technologies. Second, public services and technical support are currently unavailable or inaccessible to local herders; hence, research, development and extension interventions need to be initiated for marginalized pastoral communities. Third, rangeland institutions are incomplete and ill-organized, so institutional development of various organizations is necessary for promoting sustainable rangeland management. Fourth, the policies and governance necessary for promoting rangeland management are not well-designed; hence, governance reform and policy development need to be formulated through internal and external agencies and organizations.","|CG|GP|","|142-062-524|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708000923","doi:10.1016/j.jenvman.2008.03.005","|",".  shikui d lassoie j shrestha k k yan z sharma e pariya d institutional development for sustainable rangeland resource and ecosystem management in mountainous areas of northern nepal journal of environmental management elsevier science ltd uk rangelands represent one of the most important natural resources in mountainous regions of northern nepal however a poor understanding of the social dimensions of rangeland use has limited their proper management and sustainable development which represent major challenges for nepal s resource managers institutional development is thought to be a viable solution to this problem and may ultimately lead to improved rangeland management in nepal based on this hypothesis a study was conduced in the rasuwa district of northern nepal to examine the effectiveness of institutional development at the local and national levels in mitigating the problems facing sustainable rangeland management by using an institutional analysis and development iad framework the information and data were mainly collected from different stakeholders farmers professionals and practitioners using a toolkit of participatory rural appraisal pra workshops and literature review it can be concluded from this case study that a number of institutional development efforts are needed to promote sustainable rangeland management in this region first local herders represent a repository of rich indigenous knowledge essential to sustaining sound rangeland management practices; hence indigenous practices need to be integrated into modern technologies second public services and technical support are currently unavailable or inaccessible to local herders; hence research development and extension interventions need to be initiated for marginalized pastoral communities third rangeland institutions are incomplete and ill organized so institutional development of various organizations is necessary for promoting sustainable rangeland management fourth the policies and governance necessary for promoting rangeland management are not well designed; hence governance reform and policy development need to be formulated through internal and external agencies and organizations http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0301479708000923  .",,

Edelman's work on the language of ‘helping’ is drawn on to suggest that a focus on the microeconomics of forest dwellers diverts attention from macro-economic and political issues whose impact on the forest is far more serious.<BR>The study begins with a parable from Kalimantan, relating how the discovery of a big diamond can bring misfortune to a poor miner. It is suggested that this parable applies more generally to resource development in tropical forests, and that the major challenge is not to give more development opportunities to forest peoples but to take fewer away.<BR>This principal is illustrated with respect to gold mining, rattan gathering, and truck-farming, in Indonesia. In each case, when a forest resource acquires greater value in the broader society, it is appropriated by external entrepreneurs at the expense of local communities. A detailed case-study is presented of the development of Para Rubber cultivation. Smallholders currently dominate this cultivation, despite steadfast opposition by both contemporary and colonial governments, whose self-interests are better served by the cultivation of the Rubber on large estates.<BR>Each of these cases illustrates the predisposition of political and economic forces in the broader society to take over successful resource development in the tropical forest. Contemporary efforts to develop ‘non-timber forest products’ are reinterpreted, in this light, as attempts to allocate to the forest dwellers the resources of least interest to the broader society. The absence of research in this area is attributed not to academic oversight but to conflicting political-economic interests.<BR>This thesis of resource exploitation is at variance with the ‘rain-forest crunch’ premise: namely that forest reserves are being overexploited by forest dwellers, that this is due to the absence of other sources of income, and that the solution is to help forest dwellers to find such sources. It is suggested that there has been no lack of such sources in the past, and that the problem has been in maintaining the forest peoples' control of them. The lesson of this analysis is not to ignore minor forest products, but to place them — and their potential development value for indigenous forest peoples — clearly within their proper political-economic context.<BR>Any resolution of the problems of tropical forest development and conservation must begin, not by searching for resources that forest dwellers do not already have, but by first searching for the institutional forces which restrict the forest dwellers' ownership and productive use of existing resources. One of these institutional forces is discourse. It is widely understood that state elites seek to control valuable forest resources; it is less widely understood that an important means to this end is the control of resource-related discourse. De-mystification of the current debate over tropical deforestation and development is thus sorely needed.","|Fo|IR|","|","http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=5959164","DOI:10.1017/S0376892900037188","|",".  dove m r a revisionist view of tropical deforestation and development environmental conservation cambridge univ press this study critiques one of the prevailing theories of tropical deforestation namely that the forest is being cleared because its riches have been overlooked the purported solution to which is the marketing of ‘rainforest crunch’ edelman s work on the language of ‘helping’ is drawn on to suggest that a focus on the microeconomics of forest dwellers diverts attention from macro economic and political issues whose impact on the forest is far more serious the study begins with a parable from kalimantan relating how the discovery of a big diamond can bring misfortune to a poor miner it is suggested that this parable applies more generally to resource development in tropical forests and that the major challenge is not to give more development opportunities to forest peoples but to take fewer away this principal is illustrated with respect to gold mining rattan gathering and truck farming in indonesia in each case when a forest resource acquires greater value in the broader society it is appropriated by external entrepreneurs at the expense of local communities a detailed case study is presented of the development of para rubber cultivation smallholders currently dominate this cultivation despite steadfast opposition by both contemporary and colonial governments whose self interests are better served by the cultivation of the rubber on large estates each of these cases illustrates the predisposition of political and economic forces in the broader society to take over successful resource development in the tropical forest contemporary efforts to develop ‘non timber forest products’ are reinterpreted in this light as attempts to allocate to the forest dwellers the resources of least interest to the broader society the absence of research in this area is attributed not to academic oversight but to conflicting political economic interests this thesis of resource exploitation is at variance with the ‘rain forest crunch’ premise namely that forest reserves are being overexploited by forest dwellers that this is due to the absence of other sources of income and that the solution is to help forest dwellers to find such sources it is suggested that there has been no lack of such sources in the past and that the problem has been in maintaining the forest peoples control of them the lesson of this analysis is not to ignore minor forest products but to place them — and their potential development value for indigenous forest peoples — clearly within their proper political economic context any resolution of the problems of tropical forest development and conservation must begin not by searching for resources that forest dwellers do not already have but by first searching for the institutional forces which restrict the forest dwellers ownership and productive use of existing resources one of these institutional forces is discourse it is widely understood that state elites seek to control valuable forest resources; it is less widely understood that an important means to this end is the control of resource related discourse de mystification of the current debate over tropical deforestation and development is thus sorely needed http journals cambridge org action displayabstract frompage=online&aid=5959164  .",,

In the past decade proposals to market the environmental services provided by forests have become a reality in a wide range of settings (Pagiola et al. 2002; Landell-Mills and Porras, 2002). A key area of interest is that of watershed services, for example, flow regulation, maintenance of water quality, control of soil erosion and sedimentation, and maintenance of the hydrological functions provided by forests. With this in mind, environmentalists and conservation-minded local authorities are proposing to pay landowners to protect forest cover and thus maintain or improve hydrological integrity. At present, the environmental effectiveness of these ‘experiments’ is still being evaluated (Johnson et al. 2001).<BR>One of the questions that arises in relation to this issue is: what is the impact of ‘environmental markets’ on poverty? Through a worldwide study of green markets, the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) has found that in general it is assumed that the social impacts will be positive; however, these are rarely assessed (Landell-Mills and Porras 2002). The study examines 287 cases in which ‘markets’ are being developed for forestry services including carbon sequestration, wetlands, biodiversity protection and landscape beauty. “Markets” are deemed to exist where payment systems are set up such that beneficiaries of an environmental service compensate providers of that service. Payments may be in the form of financial or in-kind transfers.

We start with a discussion of PES definition and scope. We proceed to review some of the principal dimensions and design characteristics of PES programs and then analyze how PES compares to alternative policy instruments. Finally, we examine in detail two important aspects of PES programs: their effectiveness and their distributional implications.<BR>PES is not a silver bullet that can be used to address any environmental problem, but a tool tailored to address a specific set of problems: those in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of ecosystem managers. PES is based on the beneficiary-pays rather than the polluter-pays principle, and as such is attractive in settings where ES providers are poor, marginalized landholders or powerful groups of actors. An important distinction within PES is between user-financed PES in which the buyers are the users of the ES, and government-financed PES in which the buyers are others (typically the government) acting on behalf of ES users. In practice, PES programs differ in the type and scale of ES demand, the payment source, the type of activity paid for, the performance measure used, as well as the payment mode and amount. The effectiveness and efficiency of PES depends crucially on program design.","|MA|","|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908001420","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.03.011","|",".  engel s pagiola s wunder s designing payments for environmental services in theory and practice an overview of the issues ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk payments for environmental services pes have attracted increasing interest as a mechanism to translate external non market values of the environment into real financial incentives for local actors to provide environmental services es in this introductory paper we set the stage for the rest of this special issue of ecological economics by reviewing the main issues arising in pes design and implementation and discussing these in the light of environmental economics we start with a discussion of pes definition and scope we proceed to review some of the principal dimensions and design characteristics of pes programs and then analyze how pes compares to alternative policy instruments finally we examine in detail two important aspects of pes programs their effectiveness and their distributional implications pes is not a silver bullet that can be used to address any environmental problem but a tool tailored to address a specific set of problems those in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of ecosystem managers pes is based on the beneficiary pays rather than the polluter pays principle and as such is attractive in settings where es providers are poor marginalized landholders or powerful groups of actors an important distinction within pes is between user financed pes in which the buyers are the users of the es and government financed pes in which the buyers are others typically the government acting on behalf of es users in practice pes programs differ in the type and scale of es demand the payment source the type of activity paid for the performance measure used as well as the payment mode and amount the effectiveness and efficiency of pes depends crucially on program design http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800908001420  .",,

This paper analyzes the potential of payments for environmental services (PES) to provide an alternative to logging for these communities and to induce forest conservation. We apply a game-theoretical model of community–firm interactions that explicitly considers two stylized conditions present in the Indonesian context: (i) community rights to the forest remain weak even after decentralization, and (ii) the presence of logging companies interested in the commercial exploitation of the forest. Intuition may suggest that PES design should focus on those communities with the lowest expected payments from logging deals. However, we show that these communities may not be able to enforce a PES agreement, i.e., they may not be able to prevent logging activities by timber companies. Moreover, some communities would conserve the forest anyway; in these cases PES would not lead to additional environmental gains. Most important, the introduction of PES may increase a community's expected payoff from a logging agreement. A failure to consider this endogeneity in expected payoffs could lead to communities opting for logging agreements despite PES, simply allowing communities to negotiate better logging deals. Our results indicate that PES design is a complex task, and that the costs of an effective PES system could potentially be much higher than expected from observing current logging fees. Using data collected in Indonesia on actual logging fees received by communities, we illustrate how the theoretical results could be used in empirical analysis to guide PES design. Our results are likely to be useful in other cases where local people make resource use decisions but have weak property rights over these resources, and where external commercial forces are present. The results highlight the importance of understanding the details of the local context in order to design PES programs appropriately.","|MA|CC|IR|","|142-035-360|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907004284","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.07.028","|",".  engel s palmer c payments for environmental services as an alternative to logging under weak property rights the case of indonesia ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk decentralization reforms in indonesia have led to local communities negotiating logging agreements with timber companies for relatively low financial payoffs and at high environmental cost this paper analyzes the potential of payments for environmental services pes to provide an alternative to logging for these communities and to induce forest conservation we apply a game theoretical model of community–firm interactions that explicitly considers two stylized conditions present in the indonesian context i community rights to the forest remain weak even after decentralization and ii the presence of logging companies interested in the commercial exploitation of the forest intuition may suggest that pes design should focus on those communities with the lowest expected payments from logging deals however we show that these communities may not be able to enforce a pes agreement i e they may not be able to prevent logging activities by timber companies moreover some communities would conserve the forest anyway; in these cases pes would not lead to additional environmental gains most important the introduction of pes may increase a community s expected payoff from a logging agreement a failure to consider this endogeneity in expected payoffs could lead to communities opting for logging agreements despite pes simply allowing communities to negotiate better logging deals our results indicate that pes design is a complex task and that the costs of an effective pes system could potentially be much higher than expected from observing current logging fees using data collected in indonesia on actual logging fees received by communities we illustrate how the theoretical results could be used in empirical analysis to guide pes design our results are likely to be useful in other cases where local people make resource use decisions but have weak property rights over these resources and where external commercial forces are present the results highlight the importance of understanding the details of the local context in order to design pes programs appropriately http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800907004284  .",,

The future of tropical forests and their human inhabitants will continue to depend on the ways - wise or otherwise - in which food is procured and produced. In this book, scientists from disciplines spanning the natural and social sciences have focused on the biocultural interactions between tropical forest food resources and the communities they sustain. The volume's 74 chapters are organized into six major sections dealing with - evolution and history of tropical forests in relation to food availability, food production and nutritional value of wild and semi-cultivated species, adaptive aspects of food consumption and energy expenditure, feeding strategies in relation to environmental variation, and cultural factors in food choices and management alternatives for the rational use of topical forests in years to come.

Around half of the forests of the country occur in the coastal zone. People extract various goods and services from the mangroves. Nevertheless the mangrove forests are depleting. Although the extent of the Sundarbans forest has not changed much, its decline is of a qualitative nature. Mangrove plantations are increasing in area but they are losing growing stock. To arrest this, Bangladesh has adopted several strategies.<BR>The ‘Sustainable Ecosystem Management’ strategy has now been adopted instead of the ‘Sustained Yield Principle’. Biodiversity conservation and enhancement has been taken as a key management goal. A zoning system is being developed for both production and protection purposes. The government facilitates alternative income for the local people by generating activities for the communities which are dependent on the forest. Different non-governmental organizations collaborate with the government in reducing the local people’s dependence on the forest. Coastal plantations are erected to protect people from cyclones and to make the land more suitable for habitation. Through this greening of the coastal belt tree plantation is encouraged in coastal villages. Coastal embankments are being planted and leased to poor settlers in exchange for routine maintenance of the embankments.

The existence of the mangrove has increased the values of other coastal and marine resources such as the coastal and marine fisheries by increasing productivity and supporting a wide biological diversity. The artisanal fishery, which is highly influenced by mangroves, has been contributing 85–95% of the total coastal and marine catch of Bangladesh. The mangrove also supports offshore and deep sea fisheries by playing a significant role as nursery ground for many deep sea fishes and shrimps including the giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) which is the major species of the industrial bottom trawl fishery of Bangladesh. The mangrove also contributes significantly in shrimp farming which has been the most significant export-oriented industry since the 1970s. However, the mangrove fisheries have been under intensive pressure from deleterious fishing activities and deliberate aquaculture development by destructing mangrove habitats. The impacts of mangrove have been reflected in the contribution of artisanal fishery catch that has been in a continuous decline since the 1980s. Shrimp farming has been the most destructive contributor to mangrove destruction with a corresponding loss of biological resources particularly the wild shrimp fishery. This paper reviews different aspects of the mangrove fisheries of Bangladesh and discusses the impacts of different fisheries. The paper identifies the importance of reviewing, amending and/or replacing the traditional management approaches by the new management techniques such as habitat restoration and stock enhancement in the natural environment; the paper also identifies the need for research findings in formulating and implementing new management approaches.","|CG|CC|","|142-062-050|","http://www.springerlink.com/content/t612lvl6247qqv43/","DOI:10.1007/s11160-004-3769-8","|",".  islam m s haque m the mangrove based coastal and nearshore fisheries of bangladesh ecology exploitation and management reviews in fish biology and fisheries springer verlag gmbh the mangrove forest of bangladesh the largest continuous mangrove forest of the world is one of the most important coastal features of the country the existence of the mangrove has increased the values of other coastal and marine resources such as the coastal and marine fisheries by increasing productivity and supporting a wide biological diversity the artisanal fishery which is highly influenced by mangroves has been contributing 85–95% of the total coastal and marine catch of bangladesh the mangrove also supports offshore and deep sea fisheries by playing a significant role as nursery ground for many deep sea fishes and shrimps including the giant tiger shrimp penaeus monodon which is the major species of the industrial bottom trawl fishery of bangladesh the mangrove also contributes significantly in shrimp farming which has been the most significant export oriented industry since the 1970s however the mangrove fisheries have been under intensive pressure from deleterious fishing activities and deliberate aquaculture development by destructing mangrove habitats the impacts of mangrove have been reflected in the contribution of artisanal fishery catch that has been in a continuous decline since the 1980s shrimp farming has been the most destructive contributor to mangrove destruction with a corresponding loss of biological resources particularly the wild shrimp fishery this paper reviews different aspects of the mangrove fisheries of bangladesh and discusses the impacts of different fisheries the paper identifies the importance of reviewing amending and or replacing the traditional management approaches by the new management techniques such as habitat restoration and stock enhancement in the natural environment; the paper also identifies the need for research findings in formulating and implementing new management approaches http www springerlink com content t612lvl6247qqv43  .",,

Selected agro-commodities are soy (in Argentina and Brazil), palm oil (in Indonesia and Malaysia), beef (in Argentina and Brazil), and coffee (in Honduras and Vietnam). In each of the countries specific production areas and regions were selected, where production of the agro-commodity has shown strong expansion during the last 5 to 8 years. Using data and information on biodiversity and socioeconomic indicators available at the subnational level, a loss of biodiversity as well as a decline of critical socioeconomic indicators was observed in 54% of the studied production areas. Because in the mid-1990s several production areas had lower values for important socioeconomic indicators compared to the national average, a widening of the gap between the socioeconomic situation in production areas as compared to the national average was found in 26% of the cases studied. This corresponds to 59% of areas with a poor initial development situation. We found that factors explaining these patterns are characteristics of the commodities, macroeconomic and governance issues of the countries, as well as the history of the production area and whether production increase occurs through frontier expansion or intensification.

It also summarizes some conceptual and practical considerations related to compensating local residents who lose land use opportunities due to conservation activities. The main costs associated with conservation and the creation of national parks or reserves arise from land acquisition, hiring and training personnel, and the development of infrastructure. The costs associated with foregone uses of park land arise from the fact that local residents will no longer be able to use the areas for hunting, collecting forest products, or as a source of new agricultural land. The example of Mantadia National Park, a newly established area in the eastern rainforest of Madagascar, is presented as a case study. It was estimated that the mean value of losses for the local villagers who are dependent on the forests within the park for their livelihood was $91 per household per year.

Over the long term, success will require effectively integrating biodiversity concerns into all aspects of human development, including into major economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and &#64257; sheries. In the near term, immediate action is also required to conserve species and their habitats, primarily by establishing and maintaining nature reserves. This study examines how donor countries are allocating their biodiversity assistance and pays particular attention to the balance between support for long-term actions and near-term conservation investments. In this regard, our speci&#64257; c &#64257; ndings are as follows: Finding 1: As poverty has become the overarching focus of development assistance, biodiversity funding is increasingly framed in terms of its relation to poverty reduction. This has placed a growing emphasis on mainstreaming biodiversity into other development sectors and promoting sustainable use. At the same time, it appears to be diminishing support for shorter-term conservation investments. Finding 2: As development institutions decentralize, development assistance frameworks negotiated at the country level will become more and more important. To date, such frameworks inconsistently re&#64258; ect biodiversity concerns and seem to leave little room for conservation actions despite a proven demand for them.

This issues paper synthesizes recent practice and research that point to significant areas for further research and attention in future PES initiatives. The paper starts by analyzing the linkages between PES, forests, and poverty, where poverty is understood to be multidimensional in nature, involving deprivation across a range of assets and livelihood flows—as well as political and social marginalization and vulnerability to social and environmental risk. Given the spatial linkage between poverty and forests and the importance of such resources as ‘safety nets’ for the poorest households, PES interventions in forests are inextricably linked to the interests of the rural poor.

The government of Zanzibar has come up with an innovative system to guarantee access to international funds through its Environmental Management for Sustainable Development Act. This Act strategically enables external organisations to be designated as protected area managers while maintaining a role for the state as an intermediary in reaching local communities. The positive outcome is that it allows protected areas to be established when government resources are limited, but it also es­tablishes a dynamic where the state's struggle to maintain power and rele­vance has negative implications for programme outcomes and sustainability. In the case of Zanzibar's marine protected areas, this system results in many challenges, including confusion over the links between conservation and de­velopment objectives, the limitations of ecotourism as a development strategy, the uneven concentration of programme resources, a lack of institutional in­vestment in protected area programmes, and the negative implications for lo­cal capacity building if in future the state could be threatened by a strong civil society.

Recent studies have made it clear, however, that the alleged commercialisation-conservation/development link in the NTFP debate needs reconsideration. Although some NTFPs do play a role in rural livelihood strategies and can contribute to sustained forested landscapes in various tropical forest areas, there is no uniform picture as regards the actual importance of NTFPs to rural livelihoods. In this paper, we review several recently completed case studies on forest and NTFP use, notably by scholars based in the Netherlands. The case studies were selected as they provide location-specific information on NTFP use and form a good database for a comparative analysis of the various settings under which NTFP use and management take place. In addition, some studies are reviewed which provide insights into the broader context of forest (management) dynamics. The emerging picture is one of a more diversified approach towards forest and NTFP use, with more attention being paid to other NTFP sources than natural forests alone and to the broader socio-economic and spatial context in which forest use occurs. The new ‘resource-in-context’ approach combines insights into community-level creativity and livelihood dynamics with those into macro-economic and spatial processes, thus providing a more realistic assessment of the scope of NTFPs to contribute to improved livelihoods.","|Fo|PE|","|","http://www.cifor.org/publications/corporate/cd-roms/bonn-proc/pdfs/papers/T2_FINAL_Ros-Tonen.pdf",,"|",".  ros tonen m a f weirsum k f the importance of non timber forest products for forest based rural livelihoods an evolving research agenda paper presented at the international conference on rural livelihoods forests and biodiversity 19 23 may 2003 bonn germany agids uva amsterdam in the past the capacity of non timber forest products ntfps to contribute to tropical forest conservation and poverty alleviation was regarded as very promising recent studies have made it clear however that the alleged commercialisation conservation development link in the ntfp debate needs reconsideration although some ntfps do play a role in rural livelihood strategies and can contribute to sustained forested landscapes in various tropical forest areas there is no uniform picture as regards the actual importance of ntfps to rural livelihoods in this paper we review several recently completed case studies on forest and ntfp use notably by scholars based in the netherlands the case studies were selected as they provide location specific information on ntfp use and form a good database for a comparative analysis of the various settings under which ntfp use and management take place in addition some studies are reviewed which provide insights into the broader context of forest management dynamics the emerging picture is one of a more diversified approach towards forest and ntfp use with more attention being paid to other ntfp sources than natural forests alone and to the broader socio economic and spatial context in which forest use occurs the new ‘resource in context’ approach combines insights into community level creativity and livelihood dynamics with those into macro economic and spatial processes thus providing a more realistic assessment of the scope of ntfps to contribute to improved livelihoods http www cifor org publications corporate cd roms bonn proc pdfs papers t2_final_ros tonen pdf  .",,

What benefits and costs are created through CBNRM? Who captures these benefits, and who bears the costs? What are the key mechanisms that influence the outcomes? By answering these questions, we start to gain a clearer picture of whether the benefits of CBNRM initiatives will be sufficient to raise rural people out of poverty, and provide them with sufficient incentive to sustainably manage their resources. The learning initiative leading to this book was born of the shared interest of our organisations in understanding the challenges and successes being faced by CBNRM initiatives in generating and sharing benefits, and the critical factors that influence these outcomes. Over a period of about six months, a number of partners from three countries in the Mekong region – Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam – came together to address these questions. Through a series of case studies, national workshops and a regional workshop, we reviewed the outcomes so far of CBNRM initiatives through a ‘benefit sharing’ lens. In all three countries, the process generated very fruitful exchange between practitioners and policy makers, and between people working in sectors as diverse as fisheries, ecotourism and forestry. The initiative generated considerable interest as well as follow-up activities in these countries, and we are pleased that the findings can now be shared with a wider audience. This book captures the main lessons and issues emerging from national and regional discussions. It also presents one case study from each country, selected to highlight issues in different sectors.

Interviews, surveys, and focus group sessions were conducted in the peripheral zones of three Malagasy national parks: Ranomafana, Andohahela, and Masoala. Relevant questions explored community demographics, socioeconomic status, and local perceptions of the parks.

Workshop participants identified a wide range of measures by which the success of NTFP commercialization can be defined, which included improvements in social justice, community organization and local culture, as well as economic status. Participants then considered the factors influencing the processes involved in NTFP commercialization: production, collection, processing, storage, transport, marketing and sale. In total, 45 factors were identified that significantly limit one of the commercialization processes. Generally, product marketing and sale were found to be those processes most constraining overall success.

We test this environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) using estimates of per capita income and deforestation rates (index of biodiversity threat) for 35 tropical countries.

A closer examination of conservation practices and environmental indicators within the countries, particularly those countries that drove our initial support, suggests that wealth is not a reliable indicator of improved conservation practice.

But little is known of the comparative performance of inhabited and uninhabited reserves in slowing the most extreme form of forest disturbance: conversion to agriculture. We used satellite-based maps of land cover and fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon to compare the performance of large (>10,000 ha) uninhabited (parks) and inhabited (indigenous lands, extractive reserves, and national forests) reserves. Reserves significantly reduced both deforestation and fire. Deforestation was 1.7 (extractive reserves) to 20 (parks) times higher along the outside versus the inside of the reserve perimeters and fire occurrencewas 4 (indigenous lands) to 9 (national forests) times higher. No strong difference in the inhibition of deforestation (p= 0.11) or fire (p= 0.34)was found between parks and indigenous lands. However, uninhabited reserves tended to be located away from areas of high deforestation and burning rates. In contrast, indigenous lands were often created in response to frontier expansion, and many prevented deforestation completely despite high rates of deforestation along their boundaries. The inhibitory effect of indigenous lands on deforestation was strong after centuries of contact with the national society and was not correlated with indigenous population density. Indigenous lands occupy one-fifth of the Brazilian Amazon—five times the area under protection in parks—and are currently the most important barrier to Amazon deforestation. As the protected-area network expands from 36% to 41% of the Brazilian Amazon over the coming years, the greatest challenge will be successful reserve implementation in high-risk areas of frontier expansion as indigenous lands are strengthened. This success will depend on a broad base of political support.","|PA|IR|CS|","|019-005-076|","http://www.funai.gov.br/procuradoria/docs/Artigo%20Terras%20Ind%EDgenas.pdf","DOI:10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00351.x","|",".  nepstad d schwartzman s bamberger b santilli m ray d schlesinger p lefebvre p alencar a prinz e fiske g inhibition of amazon deforestation and fire by parks and indigenous lands conservation biology society for conservation biology conservation scientists generally agree that many types of protected areas will be needed to protect tropical forests but little is known of the comparative performance of inhabited and uninhabited reserves in slowing the most extreme form of forest disturbance conversion to agriculture we used satellite based maps of land cover and fire occurrence in the brazilian amazon to compare the performance of large >10 000 ha uninhabited parks and inhabited indigenous lands extractive reserves and national forests reserves reserves significantly reduced both deforestation and fire deforestation was 1 7 extractive reserves to 20 parks times higher along the outside versus the inside of the reserve perimeters and fire occurrencewas 4 indigenous lands to 9 national forests times higher no strong difference in the inhibition of deforestation p= 0 11 or fire p= 0 34 was found between parks and indigenous lands however uninhabited reserves tended to be located away from areas of high deforestation and burning rates in contrast indigenous lands were often created in response to frontier expansion and many prevented deforestation completely despite high rates of deforestation along their boundaries the inhibitory effect of indigenous lands on deforestation was strong after centuries of contact with the national society and was not correlated with indigenous population density indigenous lands occupy one fifth of the brazilian amazon—five times the area under protection in parks—and are currently the most important barrier to amazon deforestation as the protected area network expands from 36% to 41% of the brazilian amazon over the coming years the greatest challenge will be successful reserve implementation in high risk areas of frontier expansion as indigenous lands are strengthened this success will depend on a broad base of political support http www funai gov br procuradoria docs artigo%20terras%20ind%edgenas pdf  .",,

This has resulted in a conflict with the traditional uses of the mangrove areas, as unmodified ecosystems, including firewood gathering, thatch material (Nypa species) for homes and mangrove poles for lumber and construction materials, and nursery grounds for the small scale and commercial marine fisheries. In effect, mangrove forested areas in the Philippines have been steadily transferred from a common property resource, of multiple use and benefit to a large number of people, to a private good, of single use for shrimp ponds, whose profits are narrowly channeled to the benefit of a select few. This paper examines the trade-offs of this change in mangrove area use. The trade-offs are examined through three interlinked analyses. The first is a population dynamics model which illustrates the effect of the changes in the habitat (mangrove hectares) to the population of a single mangrove-dependent fish species from the family Leiognathidae. The paper then applies an assumed stock loss scenario from the model to a multiple objective benefit analysis and evaluates the net benefits obtained under three alternatives for the mangrove area: (1) leaving the area undeveloped; (2) developing the area for polyculture; and (3) developing the area for semi-intensive shrimp aquaculture. The procedure in the multiple objective benefit analysis is to classify the benefits to each group affected by the decision and the consequences or net benefits to the groups in aggregate.

Major debates occur over what types of policy “interventions” best protect forests, with choices of property and land tenure systems being central issues. Herein, we provide an overview of findings from a long-term interdisciplinary, multiscale, international research program that analyzes the institutional factors affecting forests managed under a variety of tenure arrangements. This program analyzes satellite images, conducts social-ecological measurements on the ground, and tests the impact of structural variables on human decisions in experimental laboratories. Satellite images track the landscape dimensions of forest-cover change within different management regimes over time. On-the-ground social-ecological studies examine relationships between forest conditions and types of institutions. Behavioral studies under controlled laboratory conditions enhance our understanding of explicit changes in structure that affect relevant human decisions. Evidence from all three research methods challenges the presumption that a single governance arrangement will control overharvesting in all settings. When users are genuinely engaged in decisions regarding rules affecting their use, the likelihood of them following the rules and monitoring others is much greater than when an authority simply imposes rules. Our results support a frontier of research on the most effective institutional and tenure arrangements for protecting forests. They move the debate beyond the boundaries of protected areas into larger landscapes where government, community, and comanaged protected areas are embedded and help us understand when and why deforestation and regrowth occur in specific regions within these larger landscapes.","|Fo|GP|","|","http://www.pnas.org/content/103/51/19224.short","doi:10.1073/pnas.0607962103","|",".  ostrom e nagendra h insights on linking forests trees and people from the air on the ground and in the laboratory pnas national academy of sciences governing natural resources sustainably is a continuing struggle major debates occur over what types of policy “interventions” best protect forests with choices of property and land tenure systems being central issues herein we provide an overview of findings from a long term interdisciplinary multiscale international research program that analyzes the institutional factors affecting forests managed under a variety of tenure arrangements this program analyzes satellite images conducts social ecological measurements on the ground and tests the impact of structural variables on human decisions in experimental laboratories satellite images track the landscape dimensions of forest cover change within different management regimes over time on the ground social ecological studies examine relationships between forest conditions and types of institutions behavioral studies under controlled laboratory conditions enhance our understanding of explicit changes in structure that affect relevant human decisions evidence from all three research methods challenges the presumption that a single governance arrangement will control overharvesting in all settings when users are genuinely engaged in decisions regarding rules affecting their use the likelihood of them following the rules and monitoring others is much greater than when an authority simply imposes rules our results support a frontier of research on the most effective institutional and tenure arrangements for protecting forests they move the debate beyond the boundaries of protected areas into larger landscapes where government community and comanaged protected areas are embedded and help us understand when and why deforestation and regrowth occur in specific regions within these larger landscapes http www pnas org content 103 51 19224 short  .",,

Market-based approaches are thought to offer considerable promise as a means to promote forest conservation, and as a new source of income for rural communities. However, it has proven difficult to translate the theory into practice. Based on extensive research and case studies of markets for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and carbon sequestration, this book demonstrates how payment systems can be established in practice, their effectiveness and their implications for the poor.

PES programs seek to capture part of the benefits derived from environmental services and channel them to natural resource managers who generate these services, thus increasing their incentive to conserve them. Many have assumed that these payments would go mostly to poor land users, and thus contribute to poverty reduction. There has been little empirical verification of this assumption to date, however. The PES approach was conceptualized as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of natural resource management, and not as a mechanism for poverty reduction. Pagiola et al. (2005) identified three main questions regarding the linkages between PES and poverty: (1) Who are the actual and potential participants in PES programs, and how many of them are poor? (2) Are poorer households able to participate in PES programs? And (3) are poor households affected indirectly by PES programs? We focus here on the first question of eligibility. This study examines whether the recipients of payments for environmental services are likely to be poor. Our focus is on watershed-scale PES mechanisms in which water users make payments to service providers. In Guatemala, as in other countries, it has long been argued that land users in marginal areas such as the steep slopes of upper watersheds tend to be poor. We use data from highland Guatemala to examine this assumed close spatial correlation between areas of high poverty and areas that provide environmental services. We first identify specific watershed areas in which PES mechanisms could potentially be developed, based on the presence of major downstream water uses such as hydroelectric power generation, domestic water supply, and irrigation. We then compare these areas with the spatial distribution of poverty in the country, allowing us to ask two questions that are central to the potential for PES to reach the poor: (1) How many of the potential providers of water services are poor? The local poverty impact of a PES program on poverty will depend on whether potential providers are poor or not. And (2) how many of the poor are potential water service providers? The potential impact of PES on poverty at a national scale will depend on whether many of the poor are in fact in areas where PES mechanisms might be implemented. Even if most potential PES recipients are poor, it may be that few of the poor are potential PES recipients. We map the “water supply areas”by identifying the location of the intakes from which users obtain their water and then delineating the portions of the watershed that contribute to those intakes. About 1.9 million ha have significant potential for development of PES mechanisms through the presence of major water uses. This area is under-estimated as data could only be obtained for a subset of all users. All water supply areas are not equivalent. Some have substantial potential for PES because of the importance of downstream water uses, while others have more limited potential. For each user, we collect information on the nature and magnitude of their water use and construct use-specific indices of the relative importance or “value” of water supply areas. With about 56% of its population under the poverty line, Guatemala has one of the highest poverty rates in Central America. Using the watershed-level poverty map developed by Nelson and Chomitz (2007), we analyze both the poverty rate and the poverty density in water supply areas. Our analysis shows that both the poverty rate and the poverty density in the water supply areas vary substantially. The average poverty rate in water supply areas is only 44 percent, which is lower than the national average of 53%. There is essentially no correlation between the importance of a water supply area and the poverty rate of people living within it. The total number of poor that could potentially be reached if PES mechanisms were developed in all water supply areas is about 1.76 million, or 73% of the country’s poor. This analysis only considers the potential for PES programs to reach the poor. Even where many of the potential service providers are poor, it does not follow that the poor will get the benefits. A variety of obstacles, including insecure land tenure, lack of title, small farm holdings, and lack of access to credit might limit the participation by the poor in a PES program. The extent to which these problems prove to be obstacles in practice depends on the specific characteristics of the PES program and the conditions under which it is implemented.","|","|","http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/42932/2/AAEAposter_Guatemala_WeiZhang_21July08ll.pdf",,"|",".  pagiola s zhang w colom a assessing the potential for payments for watershed

This paper describes the contract mechanism developed for the Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Ecosystem Management Project, which is being implemented with financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The project is testing the use of the payment-for-service mechanism to encourage the adoption of silvopastoral practices in three countries of Central and South America: Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. The project has created a mechanism that pays land users for the global environmental services they are generating, so that the additional income stream makes the proposed practices privately profitable. Designing the mechanism required addressing issues such as (1) measuring the actual amount of environmental services being provided, so that appropriate payments can be made; (2) providing payments in a way that resulted in the desired change in land use; and (3) avoiding the creation of perverse incentives (for example, for land users to cut down existing trees so as to qualify for additional payments for tree planting). Two variants of the proposed payment mechanism are being tested, with participating land users assigned randomly to one or the other. The project also includes extensive monitoring of the effectiveness of each mechanism in stimulating adoption of the proposed measures and of the resulting impact on environmental services and on household welfare.

This conclusion has major consequences for biodiversity conservation in fragmented tropical forests and the agricultural matrices in which they are embedded. Here we make the argument that the conservation paradigm that focuses on setting aside pristine forests while ignoring the agricultural landscape is a failed strategy in light of what is now conventional wisdom in ecology. Given the fragmented nature of most tropical ecosystems, agricultural landscapes should be an essential component of any conservation strategy. We review the literature on biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes and present evidence that many tropical agricultural systems have high levels of biodiversity (planned and associated). These systems represent, not only habitat for biodiversity, but also a high-quality matrix that permits the movement of forest organisms among patches of natural vegetation. We review a variety of agroecosystem types and conclude that diverse, low-input systems using agroecological principles are probably the best option for a high-quality matrix. Such systems are most likely to be constructed by small farmers with land titles, who, in turn, are normally the consequence of grassroots social movements. Therefore, the new conservation paradigm should incorporate a landscape approach in which small farmers, through their social organizations, work with conservationists to create a landscape matrix dominated by productive agroecological systems that facilitate interpatch migration while promoting a sustainable and dignified livelihood for rural communities.","|Ag|CG|CC|","|","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1439.011/full","DOI:10.1196/annals.1439.011","|",".  perfecto i vandermeer j biodiversity conservation in tropical agroecosystems a new conservation paradigm annals of the new york academy of sciences john wiley & sons inc it is almost certainly the case that many populations have always existed as metapopulations leading to the conclusion that local extinctions are common and normally balanced by migrations this conclusion has major consequences for biodiversity conservation in fragmented tropical forests and the agricultural matrices in which they are embedded here we make the argument that the conservation paradigm that focuses on setting aside pristine forests while ignoring the agricultural landscape is a failed strategy in light of what is now conventional wisdom in ecology given the fragmented nature of most tropical ecosystems agricultural landscapes should be an essential component of any conservation strategy we review the literature on biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes and present evidence that many tropical agricultural systems have high levels of biodiversity planned and associated these systems represent not only habitat for biodiversity but also a high quality matrix that permits the movement of forest organisms among patches of natural vegetation we review a variety of agroecosystem types and conclude that diverse low input systems using agroecological principles are probably the best option for a high quality matrix such systems are most likely to be constructed by small farmers with land titles who in turn are normally the consequence of grassroots social movements therefore the new conservation paradigm should incorporate a landscape approach in which small farmers through their social organizations work with conservationists to create a landscape matrix dominated by productive agroecological systems that facilitate interpatch migration while promoting a sustainable and dignified livelihood for rural communities http onlinelibrary wiley com doi 10 1196 annals 1439 011 full  .",,

Several success measures were developed and analyzed in relation to a number of independent variables categorized as contextual or project intervention factors. Correlations between individual factors and the dependent variables are discussed. Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine the most important predictors of success. These included: population size of the community, a perceived crisis in terms of reduced fish populations, successful alternative income projects, high levels of participation in community decision making, continuing advice from the implementing organization and inputs from local government.

Examples of these market based instruments are tradable pollution permits or certificates for ecosystem services. However, equity outcomes have rarely been considered in the implementation of such instruments. Neo-classical economic analysis does not explicitly take such equity considerations into account with efficiency concerns being the overriding goal. Increasingly this is being seen as inadequate to meet sustainability objectives and there is evidence to suggest that the adherence to an equitable framework for such schemes may determine whether or not stakeholders will participate in these markets. In this paper we develop a framework for consideration of equity in PES schemes. First the background and historical beginnings of these instruments are provided. A review of some existing schemes, particularly those that have tried to address income equity (pro-poor schemes), is presented and raises important issues related to efficiency versus equity concerns A framework is then provided to allow for the consideration of equity and fairness in such schemes designed to protect and enhance ecosystem services.

Tropical agriculture, particularly intensive agriculture, often supports few native organisms, and consequently has been largely overlooked in conservation planning; yet, recent work in the Neotropics demonstrates that tropical agriculture with certain features can support significant biodiversity, decades after conversion to farmland. It remains unknown whether this conservation value can be sustained for centuries to millennia. Here, we quantify the bird diversity affiliated with agricultural systems in southwest India, a region continuously cultivated for >2,000 years. We show that arecanut palm (Areca catechu) production systems retain 90% of the bird species associated with regional native forest. Two factors promote this high conservation value. First, the system involves intercropping with multiple, usually woody, understory species and, thus, has high vertical structural complexity that is positively correlated with bird species richness. Second, the system encompasses nearby forests, where large quantities of leaf litter are extracted for mulch. The preservation of these forests on productive land traces back to their value in supplying inputs to arecanut cultivation. The long-term biodiversity value of an agricultural ecosystem has not been documented in South and Southeast Asia. Our findings open a new conservation opportunity for this imperiled region that may well extend to other crops.

However, local communities benefit from many direct and indirect uses of mangrove ecosystems and may have a strong incentive to protect these areas, which puts them into direct confrontation with shrimp farm operators and, by proxy, government authorities. The article examines whether or not the full conversion of mangroves into commercial shrimp farms is worthwhile once the key environmental impacts are taken into account. The estimated economic value of mangrove forests to a local community is in the range of $27,264-$35,921 per hectare. This estimate includes the value to local communities of direct use of wood and other resources collected from the mangroves as well as additional external benefits in terms of off-shore fishery linkages and coastline protection from shrimp farms. The results indicate that, although shrimp farming creates enormous private benefits, it is not so economically viable once the externalities generated by mangrove destruction and water pollution are included.

The analysis is based on a sample of farms receiving and not receiving PES in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. Results indicate that payments have limited immediate effects on forest conservation in the region. Conservation impacts are indirect and realized with considerable lag because they are mostly achieved through land use decisions affecting non-forest land cover. PES seem to accelerate the abandonment of agricultural land and, through this process, forest regrowth and gains in services. This would be a double gain (current plus future forest services) except that our results also suggest that, in the absence of payments, forest cover would probably be similar in PES and non-PES farms and that forest regrowth would also take place, albeit at a slower rate. These findings have important policy implications. Specifically, they suggest that, locally, payments could be more effective if they are used for restoration purposes. In their current form, PES landholders have no long term obligation to let abandoned lands revert to forest. Payments for restoration would remove this uncertainty. Because of the lag in conservation outcomes, they may also be insufficient at larger geographic scales if there are other forest areas where the immediate risk of habitat and service loss is higher. In the short run, resources would be better used if invested in these higher-risk areas. At a more general level, this study lends support to the growing expectation that project administrators improve their capacity to target payments where they are most needed and not simply where they are most wanted.","|Fo|MA|CS|","|019-013-188|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800909001669","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.04.018","|",".  sierra r russman e on the efficiency of environmental service payments a forest conservation assessment in the osa peninsula costa rica ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk this study examined the efficiency of programs supporting the conservation of forest resources and services through direct payments to land owners; or payments for environmental services pes the analysis is based on a sample of farms receiving and not receiving pes in the osa peninsula costa rica results indicate that payments have limited immediate effects on forest conservation in the region conservation impacts are indirect and realized with considerable lag because they are mostly achieved through land use decisions affecting non forest land cover pes seem to accelerate the abandonment of agricultural land and through this process forest regrowth and gains in services this would be a double gain current plus future forest services except that our results also suggest that in the absence of payments forest cover would probably be similar in pes and non pes farms and that forest regrowth would also take place albeit at a slower rate these findings have important policy implications specifically they suggest that locally payments could be more effective if they are used for restoration purposes in their current form pes landholders have no long term obligation to let abandoned lands revert to forest payments for restoration would remove this uncertainty because of the lag in conservation outcomes they may also be insufficient at larger geographic scales if there are other forest areas where the immediate risk of habitat and service loss is higher in the short run resources would be better used if invested in these higher risk areas at a more general level this study lends support to the growing expectation that project administrators improve their capacity to target payments where they are most needed and not simply where they are most wanted http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800909001669  .",,

Analysis of a survey of 243 program participants and non-participants shows that farm households participating in reforestation programs had generally larger farm sizes, were dedicated to low labor-intensive, land-extensive agricultural activities, faced significant family on-farm labor constraints, were more heavily dependent on off-farm income sources, and had more extensive contact with local extension efforts.

The success of the programme is largely attributed to it being mainly funded as a poverty-relief initiative, although water users also contribute through their water fees. Nevertheless, as the hydrological benefits have become apparent, water utilities and municipalities have begun to contract WfW to restore catchments that affect their water supplies. This emerging PES system differs from others in that the service providers are previously unemployed individuals that tender for contracts to restore public or private lands, rather than the landowners themselves. The model has since expanded into other types of ecosystem restoration and these have the potential to merge into a general programme of ecosystem service provision within a broader public works programme. There is a strong case for concentrating on the most valuable services provided by ecosystems, such as water supply, carbon sequestration, and fire protection, and using these as ‘umbrella services’ to achieve a range of conservation goals. The future prospects for expansion of PES for hydrological services are further strengthened by the legal requirement that Catchment Management Agencies be established. These authorities will have an incentive to purchase hydrological services through organisations such as WfW so as to be able to supply more water to their users.","|MA|PE|","|002-018-710|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907006167","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.12.024","|",".  turpie j k marais c blignaut j n the working for water programme evolution of a payments for ecosystem services mechanism that addresses both poverty and ecosystem service delivery in south africa ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk a payments for ecosystem services pes system came about in south africa with the establishment of the government funded working for water wfw programme that clears mountain catchments and riparian zones of invasive alien plants to restore natural fire regimes the productive potential of land biodiversity and hydrological functioning the success of the programme is largely attributed to it being mainly funded as a poverty relief initiative although water users also contribute through their water fees nevertheless as the hydrological benefits have become apparent water utilities and municipalities have begun to contract wfw to restore catchments that affect their water supplies this emerging pes system differs from others in that the service providers are previously unemployed individuals that tender for contracts to restore public or private lands rather than the landowners themselves the model has since expanded into other types of ecosystem restoration and these have the potential to merge into a general programme of ecosystem service provision within a broader public works programme there is a strong case for concentrating on the most valuable services provided by ecosystems such as water supply carbon sequestration and fire protection and using these as ‘umbrella services’ to achieve a range of conservation goals the future prospects for expansion of pes for hydrological services are further strengthened by the legal requirement that catchment management agencies be established these authorities will have an incentive to purchase hydrological services through organisations such as wfw so as to be able to supply more water to their users http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800907006167  .",,

MPA Science Institute, Santa Cruz, California","Because MPAs often involve some restriction of human uses within the protected area, and thereby have the potential to adversely affect specific users and associated communities, they often generate considerable debate and concern among stakeholders. In many cases, this debate stems from, and hinges upon, the relative costs (often measured in socioeconomic terms) and benefits (often measured in ecological terms) of specific site-based proposals for MPAs, and the potential for subsequent reallocation of impacts within coastal communities. Although we are beginning to understand the natural ecology of these systems more fully, federal and state management agencies are often faced with a dearth of information on the social, cultural and economic aspects of MPAs. This critical information gap about the socioeconomic implications of MPAs jeopardizes the nation’s ability to make science-based decisions that include the human environment as well as the natural environment. To fill this need, the National Marine Protected Areas Center (NMPAC), working with several agency and nongovernmental partners, has developed a national strategy for social science research. This document identifies high priority needs for social science information that are fundamental to the planning, management and evaluation of MPAs and recommends practical ways to meet them through research, assessment, capacity building and leveraged funding. The issues identified here are national – and even international - in scope and apply to MPAs designed for many purposes under many jurisdictions.

This paper presents one of the first detailed studies of mangrove forest history. Historical changes in mangroves and their use were examined in Bais Bay and Banacon Island, Philippines. Cutting to make space for fish ponds and residential settlement has dramatically reduced the distribution of mangroves in Bais, although forest has expanded rapidly near the mouth of the largest river where soils from nearby deforested hillsides have been deposited as sediments along the coast. Heavy cutting of mangroves for commercial sale of firewood occurred under minor forest product concessions in Bais and Banacon between the late 1930s and 1979. Cutting for domestic consumption of fuel and construction wood by local people has been widespread in both areas, although rates of cutting have varied in space and over time as a result of changing demographic pressures and in response to cutting restrictions imposed by firewood concessionaires, fish pond owners and government officials. People in both Bais and Banacon have responded to declining local forest availability by planting mangroves. Early motivations to plant reflected the desire to have a ready supply of posts for construction of fish weirs. Many have also planted to protect fishpond dykes and homes from storm damage, and increasing numbers now plant as a means to establish tenure claims over mangrove areas. However, planted stands have tended to be species monocultures and to bear only limited resemblance to natural mangrove forests. In contrast to many upland forests, opportunities for protection and restoration of mangroves are limited by virtue of a highly restricted natural distribution and by competing land uses that are likely to intensify in the future. Understanding historical patterns of change can be instructive to conservationists, but the future remains laden with uncertainties.","|","|142-035-608|","http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=176879","DOI:10.1017/S0376892903000298","|",".  walters b b people and mangroves in the philippines fifty years of coastal environmental change environmental conservation cambridge univ press historical research has enhanced understanding of past human influences on forests and provides insights that can improve current conservation efforts this paper presents one of the first detailed studies of mangrove forest history historical changes in mangroves and their use were examined in bais bay and banacon island philippines cutting to make space for fish ponds and residential settlement has dramatically reduced the distribution of mangroves in bais although forest has expanded rapidly near the mouth of the largest river where soils from nearby deforested hillsides have been deposited as sediments along the coast heavy cutting of mangroves for commercial sale of firewood occurred under minor forest product concessions in bais and banacon between the late 1930s and 1979 cutting for domestic consumption of fuel and construction wood by local people has been widespread in both areas although rates of cutting have varied in space and over time as a result of changing demographic pressures and in response to cutting restrictions imposed by firewood concessionaires fish pond owners and government officials people in both bais and banacon have responded to declining local forest availability by planting mangroves early motivations to plant reflected the desire to have a ready supply of posts for construction of fish weirs many have also planted to protect fishpond dykes and homes from storm damage and increasing numbers now plant as a means to establish tenure claims over mangrove areas however planted stands have tended to be species monocultures and to bear only limited resemblance to natural mangrove forests in contrast to many upland forests opportunities for protection and restoration of mangroves are limited by virtue of a highly restricted natural distribution and by competing land uses that are likely to intensify in the future understanding historical patterns of change can be instructive to conservationists but the future remains laden with uncertainties http journals cambridge org action displayabstract frompage=online&aid=176879  .",,

Local restoration and management of mangrove forests, in particular, are now widely advocated as a solution to achieve both economic and environmental conservation goals. This paper presents findings from a study of 2 coastal sites in the Philippines that are renowned and often showcased as success stories in community-based, mangrove reforestation and management. These cases are especially intriguing because local tree planting and management emerged in both areas long before governments and nongovernment organizations began to promote such activities. These management systems are a successful economic innovation in that planted mangroves protect homes and fish pond dykes from wave and wind damage, and the production of high-value construction wood is dramatically enhanced through intensive plantation management. Mangrove plantations are an efficient alternative to harvesting from unplanted, natural mangroves and their spread may reduce harvesting pressures on existing forests.

Although there are exceptions, mangrove forest products are typically harvested in a small-scale and selective manner, with harvesting efforts and impacts concentrated in stands that are closer to settlements and easiest to access (by land or by sea). Mangroves support diverse, local fisheries, and also provide critical nursery habitat and marine productivity which support wider commercial fisheries. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services that benefit coastal communities, including coastal land stabilization and storm protection. The overlapping of marine and terrestrial resources in mangroves creates tenure ambiguities that complicate management and may induce conflict between competing interests. Mangroves have been cut and cleared extensively to make way for brackish water aquaculture and infrastructure development.

More recently, benefits from protection against erosion and extreme weather events and direct improvements in livelihoods and food security are perceived as justifications for such restoration efforts. This study examines the socioeconomic impacts of a community-led reforestation project in the Philippines through a survey of the local fishers. Revenues from mangrove fisheries, tourism and timber result in an annual benefit to the community of US$ 315 ha&#8722;1 yr&#8722;1. This figure is likely to be considerably more if the contribution of the mangrove to the coastal catch of mangrove-associated species is included. This estimate only includes direct benefits to the community from mangroves, and not intangible benefits such as coastal protection, which paradoxically is perceived by the community as one of the most important functions. More than 90% of all fishers, regardless of where they fished, thought the mangrove provided protection from storms and typhoons and acted as a nursery site and should be protected. Those fishing only in the mangrove perceived more benefits from the mangrove and were prepared to pay more to protect it than those fishing outside. This study concludes that replanting mangroves can have a significant economic impact on the lives of coastal communities.

Conservationists want to see wetlands preserved. Many governments and development organisations, on the other hand, see wetlands as unexploited resources or a hindrance to development: as essential supplies of water for domestic and irrigation needs, as land to be drained for agriculture and forestry, or simply as wastelands infested with mosquitoes. The truth is that wetlands are vital environmental sanctuaries, critical to the viable functioning of the ecosystems in which we all live. More specifically, wetlands are the sources of livelihood for the people – often poor farmers and fishers – who live in and around them. The subject of this book is the challenge of reducing poverty whilst at the same time as conserving the biological and intrinsic values of wetlands. The book draws on the experiences of four projects with financial support from Wetlands International, in Indonesia, Kenya, Zambia/Malawi and Mali, that combined conservation and development goals. The four projects demonstrated – each in a different way – how improving livelihoods and conserving wetlands can go hand in hand. The book tells the story of the problems that the individual projects faced, and how they were addressed. In addition, there is a review of seven other wetland-based projects from around the world. Each project is analysed in terms of six cross-cutting themes: poverty and livelihoods, biodiversity and ecosystem services, water management, community engagement, policy, and project management.","|Fo|PE|","|","http://wow.wetlands.org/Portals/0/publications/Book/trees%20for%20fish%20for%20web.pdf#page=64",,"|",".  koné b diallo m sidibe d planting trees to eat fish field experiences in wetlands and poverty reduction wetlands international conservation organisations value wetlands for the richness of their biodiversity – especially for their birds fish and plants conservationists want to see wetlands preserved many governments and development organisations on the other hand see wetlands as unexploited resources or a hindrance to development as essential supplies of water for domestic and irrigation needs as land to be drained for agriculture and forestry or simply as wastelands infested with mosquitoes the truth is that wetlands are vital environmental sanctuaries critical to the viable functioning of the ecosystems in which we all live more specifically wetlands are the sources of livelihood for the people – often poor farmers and fishers – who live in and around them the subject of this book is the challenge of reducing poverty whilst at the same time as conserving the biological and intrinsic values of wetlands the book draws on the experiences of four projects with financial support from wetlands international in indonesia kenya zambia malawi and mali that combined conservation and development goals the four projects demonstrated – each in a different way – how improving livelihoods and conserving wetlands can go hand in hand the book tells the story of the problems that the individual projects faced and how they were addressed in addition there is a review of seven other wetland based projects from around the world each project is analysed in terms of six cross cutting themes poverty and livelihoods biodiversity and ecosystem services water management community engagement policy and project management http wow wetlands org portals 0 publications book trees%20for%20fish%20for%20web pdf#page=64  .",,

The history of marine protected areas in the Philippines is described in relation to their present context. Devolution of authority for management of natural resources to local governments (municipalities and cities) in 1991 is highlighted as a major national policy shift that has supported more localized management efforts. Current policies and laws that influence marine protected areas are explained in relation to field management and results. One community and local government based marine protected area on San Salvador Island is contrasted with a National Marine Park being implemented under the National Integrated Protected Areas System.

A case study from the Ecuadorian Amazon region","Rp","CIFOR Occasional Paper 21",,,,,,"CIFOR","A principal criterion for classifying a tourism operation as .ecotourism. is that local residents at the site should receive substantial economic benefits, which serve both to raise local living standards and as enhanced incentives for nature conservation. This paper sets out a methodological framework for analysis of the alleged participation- income-conservation link, and applies it to the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve in the Ecuadorian Amazon region. Three Cuyabeno ethnic groups involved in tourism, the Quichuas, Siona-Secoyas and Cofans, are characterised by different tourism participation models, ranging from autonomous operations to pure salary employment. Results do not support the frequently held belief that autonomous operations are .better off. by yielding higher local benefits; rather, income size is determined by the site-specific degree of tourism specialisation, which largely depends on the tourist appeal and level of conservation of the natural site. Annual tourism cash flows are found to be much higher than previously estimated (from US$ 15 000-50 000 per village), which represents a significant rise in local purchasing power. In terms of conservation incentives, this study confirmed that income from tourism tends to change local attitudes and behaviour, such as reducing overexploitation, creating .untouchable. zones and user quotas. The more autonomous the operation, the more incentive exists to rationalise resource use. Also, the mere fact that labour time is invested in tourism leaves less opportunity for hunting and other activities that may have been practised unsustainably in the past. Further, tourism income helps to protect the Cuyabeno Reserve against important external threats, such as oil drilling and squatter colonisation. Recommendations include proposals for gradually augmenting local participation, strengthening both incentives and tourist operations in the fields of food production, handicrafts and the training of local tourist guides. Even with these safeguards, the nexus of social-economic-environmental change will often come in clusters that make it impossible to distinguish between .desirable. and .undesirable. impacts, in the unambiguous manner suggested by the axioms of ecotourism.","|CG|PE|CS|","|019-005-218|","http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-21.pdf",,"|",".  wunder s promoting forest conservation through ecotourism income a case study from the ecuadorian amazon region cifor occasional paper 21 cifor a principal criterion for classifying a tourism operation as ecotourism is that local residents at the site should receive substantial economic benefits which serve both to raise local living standards and as enhanced incentives for nature conservation this paper sets out a methodological framework for analysis of the alleged participation income conservation link and applies it to the cuyabeno wildlife reserve in the ecuadorian amazon region three cuyabeno ethnic groups involved in tourism the quichuas siona secoyas and cofans are characterised by different tourism participation models ranging from autonomous operations to pure salary employment results do not support the frequently held belief that autonomous operations are better off by yielding higher local benefits; rather income size is determined by the site specific degree of tourism specialisation which largely depends on the tourist appeal and level of conservation of the natural site annual tourism cash flows are found to be much higher than previously estimated from us$ 15 000 50 000 per village which represents a significant rise in local purchasing power in terms of conservation incentives this study confirmed that income from tourism tends to change local attitudes and behaviour such as reducing overexploitation creating untouchable zones and user quotas the more autonomous the operation the more incentive exists to rationalise resource use also the mere fact that labour time is invested in tourism leaves less opportunity for hunting and other activities that may have been practised unsustainably in the past further tourism income helps to protect the cuyabeno reserve against important external threats such as oil drilling and squatter colonisation recommendations include proposals for gradually augmenting local participation strengthening both incentives and tourist operations in the fields of food production handicrafts and the training of local tourist guides even with these safeguards the nexus of social economic environmental change will often come in clusters that make it impossible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable impacts in the unambiguous manner suggested by the axioms of ecotourism http www cifor org publications pdf_files occpapers op 21 pdf  .",,

Land-use and development options on Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil","Rp",,,,,,,"Centre for Development Research (CDR), Copenhagen, Denmark","Ilha Grande, an island in the south of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, has faced a long series of historical boom and bust cycles. Yet, during the last century, the island has recuperated most of its original forest cover, compared to rapid and continuous deforestation of the continental Atlantic forest. This paper investigates the historical determinants of forest cover changes, and relates them to the contemporary tourism boom from the two mega cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. A case study of rising backpacker tourism in a traditional fishermen's village is presented, and findings are related to other parts of the island. The common hypothesis that 'backpackers' generate no income on the island is rejected: they spend little but in places where visitor numbers are large, tourism income is amazingly high, compared to any traditional productive activity, and produces a considerable local poverty alleviation impact. The study also confirms the high economic potential of forest-based services in this case, recreation and landscape contemplation benefits in forests close to urban areas of middle-income developing countries. The large local tourism cash inflows have been used for residential construction, to buy consumer durables and additional leisure time. Although local labour requirements for tourism are generally low, rising income has implied momentous changes in the local production structure. It is argued that negative environmental impacts from tourism are under researched and probably have been over stated in previous assessments. The recommendation in these studies of implementing 'carrying capacity' based tourist access restrictions does not seem justified. A well designed entrance fee scheme to finance necessary investments in the tourism sector may be a more feasible alternative to embark on a development path of the sector beneficial for both tourists and residents, while conserving the integrity of the forested landscape.","|PE|CS|CC|","|019-005-076|","http://www.cifor.org/nc/online-library/browse/view-publication/publication/788.html",,"|",".  wunder s big island green forests and backpackers land use and development options on ilha grande rio de janeiro state brazil centre for development research cdr copenhagen denmark ilha grande an island in the south of rio de janeiro state brazil has faced a long series of historical boom and bust cycles yet during the last century the island has recuperated most of its original forest cover compared to rapid and continuous deforestation of the continental atlantic forest this paper investigates the historical determinants of forest cover changes and relates them to the contemporary tourism boom from the two mega cities rio de janeiro and sao paulo a case study of rising backpacker tourism in a traditional fishermen s village is presented and findings are related to other parts of the island the common hypothesis that backpackers generate no income on the island is rejected they spend little but in places where visitor numbers are large tourism income is amazingly high compared to any traditional productive activity and produces a considerable local poverty alleviation impact the study also confirms the high economic potential of forest based services in this case recreation and landscape contemplation benefits in forests close to urban areas of middle income developing countries the large local tourism cash inflows have been used for residential construction to buy consumer durables and additional leisure time although local labour requirements for tourism are generally low rising income has implied momentous changes in the local production structure it is argued that negative environmental impacts from tourism are under researched and probably have been over stated in previous assessments the recommendation in these studies of implementing carrying capacity based tourist access restrictions does not seem justified a well designed entrance fee scheme to finance necessary investments in the tourism sector may be a more feasible alternative to embark on a development path of the sector beneficial for both tourists and residents while conserving the integrity of the forested landscape http www cifor org nc online library browse view publication publication 788 html  .",,

Effects on service users are positive if environmental goals are achieved, while those on non-participants can be positive or negative. The various participation filters of a PES scheme contain both pro-poor and anti-poor selection biases. Quantitative welfare effects are bound to remain small-scale, compared to national poverty-alleviation goals.

To date, however, few efforts have been made to systematically compare PES experiences. Drawing on the wealth of case studies in this Special Issue, we synthesize the information presented, according to case characteristics with respect to design, costs, environmental effectiveness, and other outcomes. PES programs often differ substantially one from the other. Some of the differences reflect adaptation of the basic concept to very different ecological, socioeconomic, or institutional conditions; others reflect poor design, due either to mistakes or to the need to accommodate political pressures. We find significant differences between user-financed PES programs, in which funding comes from the users of the ES being provided, and government-financed programs, in which funding comes from a third party. The user-financed programs in our sample were better targeted, more closely tailored to local conditions and needs, had better monitoring and a greater willingness to enforce conditionality, and had far fewer confounding side objectives than government-financed programs. We finish by outlining some perspectives on how both user- and government-financed PES programs could be made more effective and cost-efficient.","|MA|PE|","|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908001432","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.03.010","|",".  wunder s engel s pagiola s taking stock a comparative analysis of payments for environmental services programs in developed and developing countries ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk payments for environmental services pes are an innovative approach to conservation that has been applied increasingly often in both developed and developing countries to date however few efforts have been made to systematically compare pes experiences drawing on the wealth of case studies in this special issue we synthesize the information presented according to case characteristics with respect to design costs environmental effectiveness and other outcomes pes programs often differ substantially one from the other some of the differences reflect adaptation of the basic concept to very different ecological socioeconomic or institutional conditions; others reflect poor design due either to mistakes or to the need to accommodate political pressures we find significant differences between user financed pes programs in which funding comes from the users of the es being provided and government financed programs in which funding comes from a third party the user financed programs in our sample were better targeted more closely tailored to local conditions and needs had better monitoring and a greater willingness to enforce conditionality and had far fewer confounding side objectives than government financed programs we finish by outlining some perspectives on how both user and government financed pes programs could be made more effective and cost efficient http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0921800908001432  .",,

However, lack of spatial differentiation in the targeting mechanism may lead to efficiency losses. Addressing this challenge, we construct an applied site selection tool, which takes into account three variables that vary in space: environmental services provided, risks of losing those services, and participation costs. Using data from Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, we empirically test the tool's potential to increase the financial efficiency of the forest-focused PES program in place. Results show that, given a fixed budget, efficiency increases radically if per hectare payments are aligned to landowners' heterogeneity in participation costs, involving opportunity, transaction and direct costs of protection, respectively. Selecting sites based on environmental service potential also moderately increases efficiency. Overall additionality could in the best case be doubled, but remains generally limited due to current low deforestation risks prevailing in Costa Rica. To take advantage of the high efficiency potentials of flexible payments, we propose inverse auction systems as a cost-effective approach for the determination of micro-level participation costs.","|MA|CS|","|019-013-188|","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180090700568X","doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.11.014","|",".  wünscher t engel s wunder s spatial targeting of payments for environmental services a tool for boosting conservation benefits ecological economics elsevier science ltd uk payments for environmental services pes have become an increasingly popular market based instrument to translate external non market environmental services into financial incentives for landowners to preserve the ecosystems that provide the services however lack of spatial differentiation in the targeting mechanism may lead to efficiency losses addressing this challenge we construct an applied site selection tool which takes into account three variables that vary in space environmental services provided risks of losing those services and participation costs using data from costa rica s nicoya peninsula we empirically test the tool s potential to increase the financial efficiency of the forest focused pes program in place results show that given a fixed budget efficiency increases radically if per hectare payments are aligned to landowners heterogeneity in participation costs involving opportunity transaction and direct costs of protection respectively selecting sites based on environmental service potential also moderately increases efficiency overall additionality could in the best case be doubled but remains generally limited due to current low deforestation risks prevailing in costa rica to take advantage of the high efficiency potentials of flexible payments we propose inverse auction systems as a cost effective approach for the determination of micro level participation costs http www sciencedirect com science article pii s092180090700568x  .",,

Linking payments for environmental services (PES) to economic development and poverty reduction is important since they may represent a new source of finance to developing countries that are potentially important suppliers of global ES. In this chapter we apply concepts from natural resource and environmental economics to a wide range of issues associated with the introduction of PES programs in the context of economic development. We introduce an economic typology of PES, showing how they can provide a solution to externalities and public good problems within the bounds of political economic constraints. Secondly, we focus on the problem of who should, and will, pay for ES. Third, we will turn to issues of program design. We assess the issue of targeting payments to achieve their objectives efficiently, with attention to the equity implications of PES programs. The final section addresses issues of monitoring and enforcement of PES contracts, and we summarize the key findings in the conclusion.","|MA|","|","http://www.springerlink.com/content/v2n63656gl3560k2/","DOI:10.1007/978-0-387-72971-8_2","|",".  zilberman d lipper l mccarthy n putting payments for environmental services in the context of economic development springer verlag gmbh paying for the provision of environmental services es is a recent policy innovation attracting much attention in both developed and developing countries linking payments for environmental services pes to economic development and poverty reduction is important since they may represent a new source of finance to developing countries that are potentially important suppliers of global es in this chapter we apply concepts from natural resource and environmental economics to a wide range of issues associated with the introduction of pes programs in the context of economic development we introduce an economic typology of pes showing how they can provide a solution to externalities and public good problems within the bounds of political economic constraints secondly we focus on the problem of who should and will pay for es third we will turn to issues of program design we assess the issue of targeting payments to achieve their objectives efficiently with attention to the equity implications of pes programs the final section addresses issues of monitoring and enforcement of pes contracts and we summarize the key findings in the conclusion http www springerlink com content v2n63656gl3560k2  .",,
