"96","/en/child-poverty.htm","/what-we-do/child-poverty","Child poverty","","<p>Children still die because their parents cannot get the treatment they need, or afford enough food to keep them healthy. And in the UK, <a href=""/what-we-do/child-poverty/uk-child-poverty"">1.6 million children are living in severe poverty</a>. Being born into a poor family dramatically reduces a child’s chances of a brighter future. This must change.</p></p> <p>More than 8 million children died last year, most from preventable conditions and diseases. Almost all of these child deaths take place in developing countries, and within these countries children from the poorest backgrounds are least likely to survive. That’s wrong.</p> <p>Our research has shown that even relatively poor countries like Bolivia and Ghana have reduced the numbers of children dying. They’ve done this by focusing resources on helping the poorest and most disadvantaged people.</p> <p>Countries making slow or no progress on reducing the number of children dying tend to have greater disparities between the richest and poorest people living there. This shows that the approach a government takes – not its resources – is most important in reducing child mortality.</p><a href=""/where-we-work/united-kingdom""></a></STRONG> <p><strong>Video: Aftin's story —  growing up hungry and poor in Kenya  </strong></p> <div style=""position:relative; clear: both; height:295px; margin-bottom:20px""> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:0px; left:0px; height:114px; width:470px; z-index:100""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:114px; left: 245px; height:25px; width:225px; z-index:100""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:114px; left:0px; height:25px; width:225px; z-index:100; ""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:247px; left:422px; height:34px; width:44px; z-index:100;""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; height:295px; width:470px;""> <object width=""470"" height=""295""> <param name=""movie"" value=http://www.youtube.com/v/ryFJkyqkqAU?showsearch=0&loop=0&fs=0&fmt=22&showinfo=0&rel=0&color1=0x60666C&color2=0x788087&border=1 /> </param> <param name='type' value='application/x-shockwave-flash'> <param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always'> <param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""false"" > <param name=""wmode"" value=""opaque""> </param> <embed src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ryFJkyqkqAU?showsearch=0&loop=0&fs=0&fmt=22&showinfo=0&rel=0&color1=0x60666C&color2=0x788087&border=1 type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""470"" height=""295"" allowfullscreen=""false"" allowscriptaccess='always' wmode=""opaque"" > </embed> </object> </div> </div> <p class=image-caption>Aftin, 12, lives in El Wak, in Northeastern Kenya.

The first of these asks governments to ensure that children under the age of 18 are not forcibly recruited into their armed forces. It also requires governments to do everything they can to make sure members of their armed forces who are under the age of 18 do not take part in combat.</p> <p>The second of these protocols calls on states to prohibit child prostitution and child pornography and the sale of children into slavery. So far, both protocols have already been ratified by more than 120 states.</p> <p>The <abbr title=""United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child"">UNCRC</abbr> is also the only international human rights treaty to give NGOs (non-governmental organisations) like Save the Children a direct role in overseeing its implementation, under Article 45a. </p>"

Since the Industrial Revolution humans have burned fossil fuels, releasing greenhouse emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which build up in the atmosphere, and trap heat. As their concentration increases, so do the levels of heat.</p> <p>The resulting rise in temperature of the earth's atmosphere in turn affects weather patterns. Global warming is making some places drier and some wetter, and increasing the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events like droughts, floods and cyclones.</p> <p>Climate change disrupts seasonal patterns, which can have a negative impact on crop yields. It's also creating more extreme weather patterns. Over the past two decades the number of natural disasters has doubled. More floods, cyclones and droughts means more children’s lives are at risk. </p> <h2>Impact on children potentially devastating </h2> <p>Climate change poses severe threats to child survival and wellbeing, food security and nutrition, as well as children’s access to education and protection. They will face more natural disasters as well as reduced access to water, malnutrition and changing disease patterns.  </p> <p>What’s more, some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as <a href=""/where-we-work/africa/ethiopia"">Ethiopia</a> and <a href=""/where-we-work/asia/bangladesh"">Bangladesh</a>, have significantly high numbers of children under the age of 14 years old. These children will have to live with the impacts for years to come.  </p> <h2>Related reading</h2> <p><a href=""/resources/online-library/right-to-a-future-climate-change-negotiations-must-be-accountable-to-children"">Right to a Future: Climate change negotiations must be accountable to children </a></p> <p><a href=""/resources/online-library/feeling-the-heat-child-survival-in-a-changing-climate"">Feeling the Heat report</a></p>"

There are four steps that are usually part of a large-scale emergency response:","<img class=""image-right"" src=""/sites/default/files/how_we_respond218x147.jpg"" alt=""Save the Children staff unload corrogated iron sheets of a truck as part of the emergency response to the earthquate in Pakistan""> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <a title=""Preparation and training"" href=""#SECTIONONE"">Preparation and training </a><br><strong>Step 2</strong>: <a title=""Immediate help"" href=""#SECTIONTWO"">Immediate help</a> <br><strong>Step 3</strong>: <a title=""Full-scale relief effort"" href=""#SECTIONTHREE"">Full-scale relief effort </a><br><strong>Step 4</strong>: <a title=""Helping children and families rebuild their lives"" href=""#SECTIONFOUR"">Helping children and families rebuild their lives</a><br><br></p><a name=SECTIONONE></a> <h2>Preparation and training </h2> <p>Save the Children UK is part of the International Save the Children Alliance, a group of organisations that work in more than 100 countries around the world. This means that we often have staff working in countries where disasters might take place. We train staff in those countries so that they can respond quickly and efficiently in the event of an emergency. </p> <p>Save the Children also works with communities to help them prepare for a disaster so that they can respond in the best way to avoid a loss of life. </p><a name=SECTIONTWO></a> <h2>Immediate help </h2> <p>Natural disasters, like floods and tsunamis, often happen within seconds. But those disasters can kill thousands and leave hundreds of thousands more at risk of perishing if they don't receive help. Conflicts can force people to flee their homes leaving only with what they can carry on their backs.</p> <p>When an emergency strikes, our teams on the ground and our local partners work flat-out to reach vulnerable communities and prevent further loss of life. In order to respond appropriately, we take some time to consult with children and their families to find out what people really need. We start to source essential relief supplies, like water containers, food, mosquito nets, blankets and materials to build temporary shelters. We buy supplies locally wherever possible.</p><a name=SECTIONTHREE></a> <h2>Full-scale relief effort</h2> <p>In the aftermath of an emergency, Save the Children immediately begins assessing the scale of the problem and planning how to respond. Our team of international experts often help support this process. In a large-scale emergency we might fly in specialist emergency staff, such as nutrition and logistics experts, and extra supplies and equipment that are desperately needed and cannot be bought locally. </p> <p>Days after the Asian tsunami struck on 26 December 2004, we sent critical supplies on a flight to Sri Lanka, such as portable generators, satellite phones and water purification tablets. The 1.2 million water purification tablets sent provided enough clean drinking water for 37,000 families for a week. </p> <p>Disasters often separate children from their parents. These vulnerable children need to be reunified with their parents or surviving relatives as soon as possible. But when communities have been torn apart and thousands of people have been displaced, this isn't as easy as it sounds. We have helped thousands of lost children find their parents.</p><a name=SECTIONFOUR></a> <h2>Rebuilding lives</h2> <p>Even during difficult times it's important to give children a sense of normality. This can be done by providing them with temporary schools and a safe place to play.  <p>On 27 May 2006, an earthquake struck central Java, Indonesia. It killed nearly 6,000 people and damaged 500,000 houses. Save the Children provided emergency education facilities to nearly 14,000 children by providing tents, desks and school materials and by training nearly 650 local teachers. We also gave 2,500 children 50 safe spaces - places where they could play with other children and recover from their traumatic experiences. <p>As the situation stabilises after an emergency, Save the Children works hard to help people rebuild their lives. Sometimes people have lost everything in a disaster. In some cases, we provide people with the money they need to restart their farms or businesses. <br> <br>Poor rainfall in parts of Kenya led to a humanitarian emergency in 2005. Crops failed to grow which led to high rates of malnutrition in children and up to 75 per cent of all livestock being lost. Livestock, such as cows and goats, provide families with food and security. We provided families with cash so that they could purchase new animals best suited to their needs.</p> <h2>More information</h2> <p>Read the <a title=""Emergency response updates"" href=""/resources/online-library/emergency-response-updates"">history of Save the Children's emergency responses</a></p> <h2>How we hold ourselves accountable and improve our work</h2> <p>Save the Children staff are bound by the principles laid out in <a title=""The Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief"" href=""http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JMNB?OpenDocument"">The Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in Disaster Relief</a>.

Because of poverty, people are often forced to live in areas more prone to be affected by natural disasters and, because of climate change, some natural disasters are on the increase. </p> <p>Other emergencies - such as famine and war - build up over time and can be predicted. Some children grow up living in emergencies, as they can last for many years with a state of crisis becoming the norm.</p> <p>Conflicts can force people to move to somewhere safer with only the possessions that they can carry with them. Save the Children works to protect families' rights to basic services (like water and sanitation) and to make sure that children can get an education wherever they are. We also work to limit the effects of conflict on children and their families.</p> <h2>Children are most at risk </h2> <p>Whenever a disaster strikes, children are particularly vulnerable. In an instant they may lose their home, their community, their security and everything they have. They face multiple threats from violence, disease, malnutrition, trauma and lack of shelter, water, food and education. </p> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/emergency534x321.jpg""></p> <h2>Understanding and helping children in an emergency</h2> <p>Understanding and responding to children's basic needs and vulnerabilities are central to our work. Save the Children UK is part of the International Save the Children Alliance, a group of organisations that work in more than 100 countries around the world. Our staff are often already working in countries hit by an emergency and are trained to respond quickly to get immediate help to children and families. We also help in the long-term regeneration of those communities.</p>"

There are more floods, cyclones, droughts, and severe cold spells. Glaciers and ice caps are melting, and rainfall patterns are changing. </p> <p>Experts predict that urbanisation, population growth, and <a href=""/what-we-do/climate-change"">climate change</a> will only increase the severity and impact of disasters in the future.</p> <h2>What is Disaster Risk Reduction?</h2> <p>Disaster Risk Reduction helps to prepare communities, and increase resilience against the impact of disasters and climate change. It can be policies, strategies or activities carried out to reduce a community’s vulnerability to a disaster. </p> <p>We work with children, local communities and governments to ensure they have emergency plans in place. We help reduce the risk of an emergency by, for example, building embankments to protect communities from flooding. In <a href=""/where-we-work/asia/india"">India,</a> we built shelters in flood- and earthquake-prone areas, and in <a href=""/where-we-work/asia/myanmar-burma"">Myanmar </a>(Burma) we helped to reinforce schools so that people have a safe shelter if there is another cyclone.In <a href=""/where-we-work/asia/sri-lanka"">Sri Lanka</a>, we provided megaphones and loudspeakers so people have more time to respond to an impending disaster. </p> <p>We also promote resilience so that communities can cope and recover after disaster strikes.

And we annually transfer food or cash to reduce the risk of food crises among poor families. </p> <p>We’re carrying out this work in more than 35 countries around the world.</p> <h2>Children saving children</h2> <p>We put children at the heart of our Disaster Risk Reduction activities. Children are more vulnerable during emergenices, so we listen to children to make sure we're really meeting their needs. </p> <p>Children are involved in identifying the risks they face, developing action plans to tackle those risks and pressing their governments to ensure all children are reached through Disaster Risk Reduction programmes.  </p> <p>In <a href=""/where-we-work/asia/vietnam"">Vietnam</a>, children told us how to keep them safer if another cyclone hit. </p> <p>""We thought we knew what needed to be done.

They die of:</p> <ul> <li>basic illnesses, such as pneumonia, when they’re weakened by malnutrition </li> <li>diarrhoea, when they can’t get clean water or sanitation </li> <li>preventable diseases, when the health system can’t give them vaccinations.</li></ul> <p>A lack of education for girls means that, when they become mothers, their children are more likely to die. Conflicts and disasters also lead to poor health and high rates of child deaths. We know that influencing these factors will help keep children alive and healthy.</p> <p>Good health is both an indicator of and a requirement for a country’s development. Communities need their children to survive into adulthood and contribute to its growth.</p> <h2>Children’s right to health</h2> <p>Ensuring children grow up healthy is one of our highest priorities. We’re fighting child deaths, reaching almost 2.2 million children in 21 countries with support to help them access better healthcare and nutrition from 2008 to 2009.</p> <p>Every day, 1,400 children die from an AIDS-related illness, and another 1,800 are newly infected with HIV.

A significant proportion of babies are born with low birth weight. After two years of age it’s much harder to reverse the effects of chronic malnutrition. </p> <p>So, if a pregnant woman and a baby under the age of two have access to an adequate and nutritious diet, the child’s future opportunities are greatly improved. We research and help children affected or most at risk of malnutrition, and we lobby for improved policies to combat the problem. </p> <p>Our comprehensive approach always includes a combined focus on nutrition, people’s access to food, and how they can earn a living to pay for food - particularly cash transfers - so families can be better prepared and more able to cope with natural and economic shocks.</p> <p><a href=""/what-we-do/hunger/how-we-tackle-hunger""><strong>Find out more about how we tackle hunger</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Our report </strong><a href=""/resources/online-library/hungry-for-change-an-eight-step-costed-plan-of-action-to-tackle-global-child-hunger""><strong>Hungry for Change</strong></a><strong> presents an eight-step plan of action for tackling global child hunger.</strong></p>"

They eat very narrow diets, often only one type of food, and they don’t have enough on a persistent, daily basis. And it’s this that undermines children’s futures. They are ill more often, less successful in school and earn less as adults. Breaking the cycle of poverty starts with good nutrition.”</p> <h2>Pioneering work</h2> <p>In 2009 our pioneering work to provide cash payments to hungry families demonstrated in increasing numbers of countries that, where parents have money, their children eat a more diversified and nutritious diet. Our report, Lasting Benefits, set out the case for investing in cash transfers to improve the nutrition of mothers and children. In a review, the Lancet said that the effects of lifting families with young children out of poverty “will last for generations”.</p> <p>In <a href=""/where-we-work/africa/ethiopia"">Ethiopia</a>, we helped families feed their children nutritious diets through a combination of direct aid, cash payments and investing in people’s livelihoods. All told, our nutrition programmes in Ethiopia reached more than 71,000 people.</p> <p>We also saw the start of an innovative £4 million European Community-funded programme in North East Province, <a href=""/where-we-work/africa/kenya"">Kenya</a>, which has the potential to provide a new model of food aid. It will give at least 10,000 families vouchers that they can exchange for milk and meat produced by local pastoralists and sold by local traders. That way, child and family nutrition improves, and the local pastoral economy is boosted.</p> <p>But we know we can never tackle malnutrition on our own. We need concerted government action. That’s why our advocacy success in 2009 were so important. Read about them <a href=""/what-we-do/hunger/how-we-tackle-hunger"">here</a>.</p>"

Now he is slowly improving. Nearly half of all children under five in Bangladesh are under-weight or small for the age as a result of malnutrition.</p> <h2>Our tools for measuring hunger</h2> <p>The most effective strategies to prevent child malnutrition are those that are based on a good understanding of the causes of the problem. Our <a href=""/resources/online-library/the-cost-of-the-diet"">Cost of the Diet</a> method is a unique approach that helps calculate the minimum amount of money a family will have to spend to meet their energy, protein, fat and micronutrient requirements using locally available foods. Our Cost of the Diet work has been important in raising awareness internationally on the extent to which poverty limits progress in reducing malnutrition among children.</p> <p>Our <a href=""/resources/online-library/the-household-economy-approach-a-guide-for-programme-planners-and-policy-makers"">Household Economic Approach</a> was also developed to help predict food shortages through the collection and analysis of information on how rural households live and make ends meet. </p> <h2>Our solution: eight-step plan for tackling hunger</h2> <p>Our recent report, <a href=""/resources/online-library/hungry-for-change-an-eight-step-costed-plan-of-action-to-tackle-global-child-hunger"">Hungry for Change</a>, shows that eight interventions are essential for improving the diets of pregnant women and young children. The interventions are: </p> <ul> <li>Promoting and supporting breastfeeding </li> <li>Supplementing micronutrients and carrying out deworming </li> <li>Increasing the availability and reducing the cost of nutritious food </li> <li>Cash transfers. Providing cash payments, like pensions or benefits, allow poor families to buy nutritious foods and build up their assets, such as livestock. </li> <li>Investmentings in nutrition- friendly agriculture and livestock policies </li> <li>Providing fortified foods required for children to grow up strong and healthy </li> <li>Educational work on nutrition, hygiene and food preparation practices </li> <li>Creating information systems that provide the basis for long-term planning and for rapid response during an emergency </li> <li>Managing the treatment of severe acute malnutrition better.</li></ul> <p>Our eight-step plan reflects the need for a comprehensive and integrated response to under-nutrition combining immediate and long-term interventions. It also presents the cost of ensuring that these interventions reach children at the critical period of their lives, and highlights the key role of donors, the UN, developing country governments and civil society need to play in order to ensure that <a href=""/what-we-do/child-rights/millennium-development-goals"">Millennium Development Goal 1</a> is achieved.</p> <h2>Our advocacy success</h2> <p>Our <em>Hungry for Change</em> report showed that there’s no excuse for inaction. It would cost $8.8 billion a year for a package of measures to prevent malnutrition among mothers and young children in eight countries that are home to half the world’s malnourished children. This is less than half of what the world spends on bottled water in a year. </p> <p>That’s why advocacy achievements on nutrition in 2009 were so critical. </p> <ul> <li>We helped convince the UK Department for International Development to develop a nutrition strategy to ensure that the aid it gives will improve the nutrition of 12 million children over the next five years – one in ten of all undernourished children in the world. </li> <li>The European Commission, the largest food-aid provider in the world, also revised its food-assistance strategy to put mothers’ and children’s nutrition first.</li> <li>With a handful of other aid agencies, we influenced the reform of the Committee on World Food Security to help ensure that the nutrition of the world’s poorest women and children is considered just as important as investing in growing more food. </li></ul> <p>“Paying for proper nutrition isn’t a band aid,” says Alex Rees, our Head of Hunger Reduction Policy. “It’s an investment in people so they can increase development in their own countries. It’s something we would want for our own children. If you don’t have the right to adequate food and nutrition, you don’t have anything else.”</p> <p></p> <p>Watch DFID's video about undernutrition and where to go from here:</p> <div style=""position:relative; clear: both; height:295px; margin-bottom:20px""> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:0px; left:0px; height:114px; width:470px; z-index:100""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:114px; left: 245px; height:25px; width:225px; z-index:100""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:114px; left:0px; height:25px; width:225px; z-index:100; ""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; background:#0F3; filter: alpha(opacity=0); opacity:0; top:247px; left:422px; height:34px; width:44px; z-index:100;""></div> <div style=""position:absolute; height:295px; width:470px;""> <object width=""470"" height=""295""> <param name=""movie"" value=http://www.youtube.com/v/aLGXBDva4c4?showsearch=0&loop=0&fs=0&fmt=22&showinfo=0&rel=0&color1=0x60666C&color2=0x788087&border=1 /> </param> <param name='type' value='application/x-shockwave-flash'> <param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always'> <param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""false"" > <param name=""wmode"" value=""opaque""> </param> <embed src=http://www.youtube.com/v/aLGXBDva4c4?showsearch=0&loop=0&fs=0&fmt=22&showinfo=0&rel=0&color1=0x60666C&color2=0x788087&border=1 type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""470"" height=""295"" allowfullscreen=""false"" allowscriptaccess='always' wmode=""opaque"" > </embed> </object> </div> </div>"

Trafficked children are criminalised. Children who have been abandoned and abused are locked up in institutions. Working children are removed from work that is an essential prop to their family’s survival. </p> <h2>Taking a stand </h2> <p>In 2009, we took a stand for children across the world.  </p> <ul> <li> <p>In Pakistan our report on the state of child rights, published in June 2009, exposed profound government failures. “Lack of legislation pushed hundreds of thousands of children into the dark shadows of labour, trafficking, drug abuse, judicial injustice, early marriages and illiteracy,” said our Pakistan Country Director Mohammed Qazilbash. Comic Relief is funding a £3 million project in the province of Sindh to get 20,000 children out of child labour and into school or vocational training.</p></li> <li> <p>In Indonesia, half a million children are living in institutions – most because their parents are too poor to see them educated, not because they're orphans. We’re working closely with the Ministry of Social Affairs to create a major shift in policy and practice in the way children are protected. We’re establishing national standards of care and a regulatory framework for placing children in institutions.</p></li> <li> <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, 50,000 children, some as young as six, work as miners. We helped 12,000 leave the mines and get back to school. </p></li> <li>In Jammu and Kashmir, the northernmost state of India, civil unrest and natural disasters have combined to make orphans of up to 100,000 children. In an area with few orphanages and little legal protection, they’re at risk of child labour, trafficking and abuse. With funding from ECHO we helped build 13 model orphanages, set up child-protection committees in 128 villages and 64 pioneering children’s committees, and provided educational, vocational and livelihood support to nearly 2,000 orphans. </li></ul> <p><strong>See our leaflet, </strong><a href=""/en/docs/child_protection_systems.pdf""><strong>Protect one, protect all</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>"

How can we help them?","<h2>Keeping children out of harmful institutions</h2> <p>“One of the punishments was rolling along the ground until you threw up – you’re not allowed to stop,” said Ali, 17, about the seven years he spent in a children’s home in Maluku, Indonesia. “I was hit in the stomach as well. I had to hold my breath so as not to be sick.” </p> <p>Our experience shows that it’s nearly always better for children to live in a family set-up, rather than in an institution like an orphanage. Institutional care can cause real damage to children's physical, cognitive and emotional development, and may inflict further abuse and neglect. </p> <p>Read more in our report on <a href=""/resources/online-library/keeping-children-out-of-harmful-institutions-why-we-should-be-investing-in-family-based-care"">children in institutional care</a>.</p> <p>Where it’s not possible for children to live with their parents or relatives, our experience shows the best alternatives are for them to be fostered or adopted. </p> <p>At the moment these options don’t always exist. In Indonesia, for example, up to half a million children are growing up in residential care. We’re working with the Ministry of Social Affairs to raise standards while better alternatives are developed.  </p> <h2>Helping communities to care</h2> <p>It’s vital that communities get involved in protecting vulnerable children. We support community groups that help to look after vulnerable children, such as those whose parents have died or who are at risk of being trafficked. These groups can pick up on cases of abuse and exploitation, and spread the word about the dangers children in their community face.</p> <p>Read our latest report on <a href=""/resources/online-library/what-are-we-learning-about-protecting-children-in-the-community"">protecting children in the community</a>.</p> <p>In India, in the state of West Bengal, we’ve helped to set up child protection committees in hundreds of villages. The committees are made up of children, parents, teachers, health workers and other community members. They raise awareness in their town or village about issues like trafficking, child abuse in workplaces, early marriage and use of corporal punishment. Over 4 years, the committees helped more than 1,200 children leave work and return to school, and helped bring about the arrest of 100 traffickers. </p> <h2>Supporting parents</h2> <p>We support parents and families so they can care for their children. We make sure families get services like healthcare and education and help them increase their incomes through cash transfers and livelihood support.</p> <p>For example, Rebecca, who lives in Bauchi state in Nigeria, looks after her five children on her own since her husband died. “It was difficult to afford to feed my children and send them to school, despite the support I got from relatives and neighbours,” she says. Rebecca got a small grant from a Save the Children Child Protection Committee to help her start a business selling sugar cane. Now she is able to afford health, education and food for her five children. “It doesn’t make a big profit, but it helps me afford the basics,” she says.</p>"

Or, in the chaos of conflict, children become separated from their parents and are forced to join a militia group to survive. They may work as combatants, cooks or ‘wives’, who are often brutally sexually abused. </p> <p>We reunite children with their families, reintegrate them back into their communities and give them a more hopeful future. </p> <p>When a natural disaster strikes – the <a href=""/what-we-do/emergencies/haiti-emergency"">Haiti earthquake </a>or the 2004 Asian tsunami, for example – many children get separated from their families. Our protection teams work on the ground to identify children who are at risk, provide interim care and try to trace their families. </p> <p>On the ground, in Haiti and other emergencies, we help keep children safe by providing ‘child-friendly’ spaces. Children whose lives have been turned upside down get the chance to play, learn and be with their friends. </p> <p>In the world’s biggest refugee camp, in Dabaab in eastern <a href=""/where-we-work/africa/kenya"">Kenya</a>, we helped set up child welfare committees, foster-parent groups and children’s clubs, and we train police, teachers and others in child protection.</p> <p>Refugee and internally displaced children are vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation by adults in positions of power, such as  peacekeepers and local businessmen. We drew the world’s attention to the sexual abuse of children by aid workers and peacekeepers with our report, <a href=""/resources/online-library/no-one-to-turn-to-the-under-reporting-of-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-by-aid-workers-and-peacekeepers"">No One to Turn To</a>, which was welcomed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and, according to The Lancet, caused “shockwaves”. </p> <p> </p>"

In South Africa we’ve set up centres for children crossing the border from Zimbabwe. Where appropriate, staff at the centres help trace children’s parents, and they ensure that girls in particular learn about safe sex. </p> <p>Find out more about children’s experience of migration in southern Africa in our report <a href=""/resources/online-library/our-broken-dreams-child-migration-in-southern-africa"">Our Broken Dreams</a>.</p> <h2>Trafficked children</h2> <p>Rosham, 14, was trafficked to Haryana state, 1000 km from his home.

All we ask is that when you have taken care of your family and friends, you consider the causes and charities that you care about.</p> <h2>Why make a gift in my will to remember Save the Children?</h2> <p>A gift in your will costs you nothing during your lifetime and won’t affect you now, but will one day make a huge difference to the <a href=""/get-involved/legacies/an-amazing-gift"">lives of countless children</a>.</p> <h2>Can I have a say in where my gift is used?</h2> <p>Of course you can tell us what area of our work you would like your gift to support and we will make every effort to see that this happens. It is difficult to know which areas of our work we will need to focus on in future. Please contact us by phone: 020 7012 6400 or email: <a href=""mailto:legacies@savethechildren.org.uk"">legacies@savethechildren.org.uk</a> to discuss this in more detail.</p> <p>The wishes of our supporters are very important to us, so if you would like to have your loved ones involved in deciding how the money should be spent, we would be more than happy to help.</p> <h2>Do I have enough money to leave a gift in my will?</h2> <p>Every gift we receive from our supporters – large or small – is important to us, and contributes towards changing millions of children’s lives. Even a small percentage of your estate can make a big difference to charity, whilst safeguarding both your intentions and your loved ones interests.</p> <h2>What will it cost?</h2> <p>Writing a will is not as expensive as you might think. Solicitors can provide estimates on request, but the cost will depend on how complex your affairs are.</p> <p>You may like to consider writing your will during the month of November with a participating Will Aid solicitor. This scheme benefits several charities, including Save the Children. Solicitors donate their time, and those making their will are able to donate to many of the UK’s favourite causes.</p> <h2>How much does Save the Children spend overall on fundraising and administration costs?</h2> <p>On average, over the last five years, for every £1 you gave us, we spent 85p to benefit children and used the remaining 15p to raise the next £1.</p> <h2>What should I consider when I prepare my will?</h2> <p>Our simple guide helps explain the things you may want to think about when preparing to make a will. </p> <p><a href=""/en/docs/Guide-to-making-a-will.pdf"">Download our Guide to Making a Will</a> (PDF 1.1MB)</p> <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us by filling out our gift in wills <a href=""http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/assets/php/legacy.php"">enquiry form</a> or by phone 020 7012 6400 or email <a href=""mailto:legacies@savethechildren.org.uk "">legacies@savethechildren.org.uk </a></p> <h2>What types of gifts in wills are there?</h2> <p>There are three different types of gifts in wills (legacies): residuary, pecuniary, and specific.</p> <p>A <strong>residuary legacy</strong> is when a person leaves a percentage of their estate after all the other legacies have been made and debts cleared. One of the advantages of a residuary legacy is that it has the benefit of being inflation-proof and means you’re less likely to need to update your will in the future.</p> <p>A <strong>pecuniary legacy</strong> is a gift of a specified sum of money.</p> <p>A <strong>specific legacy</strong> is a gift of a particular item such as books, paintings, antiques, or jewellery.</p> <p>All bequests should be left to Save the Children UK and must use our registered charity numbers 213890 and SC039570 and the correct registered address: Save the Children Fund, 1 St John’s Lane, London EC1M 4AR.</p> <p>Your solicitor will advise on the specific wording you need to use for different types of gifts. </p> <h2>How do I make a gift to Save the Children in my Will? What information do I need to include?</h2> <p>If you wish to remember Save the Children in your will, we recommend that you use the following wording:</p> <p>I leave….to Save the Children Fund of 1 St John’s Lane, London EC1M4AR, registered charity numbers 213890 and SC039570.</p> <h2>What if I want to change my will?</h2> <p>You need to remember that if your circumstances change, your will may become out of date or invalid. Ensure your will is up to date by either writing a new one or amending and updating your existing one using a codicil. A codicil is a document that amends, rather than replaces, a previously executed will. We recommend that you consult a legal professional to update your will.</p> <h2>Can I add Save the Children to my existing will?</h2> <p>Making changes to an existing will is simple. You will need to ask your solicitor to advise you on the drafting of a codicil, which will then need to be signed by two independent witnesses. Your solicitor will be able to provide you with a codicil document.</p> <h2>Will the gift in my will be confidential?</h2> <p>Save the Children will act in a professional manner and respect your privacy at all times. We will not pass on any details of your will or confidential information.</p> <p>If you would like to share your personal reasons or story as to why you have chosen to remember Save the Children, we would love to hear from you. This can be a great way to encourage others to consider this wonderful way to support our work in future.</p> <h2>What about inheritance tax?</h2> <p>In order to review your personal tax situation, we recommend that you consult your solicitor when making changes to your will. Please see <a href=""http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/index.htm"">further information</a> about changes to inheritance tax.</p> <p>In 2009, the government set the inheritance tax threshold at £325,000, above which inheritance tax is payable at the rate of 40%. If your estate is liable to attract inheritance tax, leaving a gift to charity can have the effect of reducing the overall tax burden on <a href=""http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/giving/will.htm"">family and friends</a>.</p> <h2>What should I do if I’m acting as an executor of a will?</h2> <p>You can find further information and advice on your responsibilities on the <a href=""http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/legacies_advice-for-executors.htm"">executor page</a>.</p> <h2>How else could I help Save the Children?</h2> <p>You can volunteer as a fundraiser, in a shop, take part in an event or be a speaker. <a href=""/get-involved/volunteer"">Find out more about volunteering for Save the Children </a>. You could help us to raise awareness about how important legacies are to our work by: </p> <ul> <li>introducing gifts in wills to your friends </li> <li>passing on our materials </li> <li>sharing your personal story with others </li></ul> <p style=""font-size: 120%; background-color: #894; font-family: GillSansWBbold, arial; padding: 4px""><span>Contact the legacies team on:</span> <span style=""color: #fff"">020 7012 6400</span></p>"

Instead of paying a fee for this will-writing service, you’re invited to make a donation to charity.","<img src=""/sites/default/files/title-willaid.jpg""> <p>Will Aid runs every year throughout November. The scheme puts people who want to make their wills in touch with will-writing solicitors. It’s a great way to sort out your affairs. At the same time you’ll help charities that Will Aid supports. Save the Children is one of the nine charities that benefit.</p> <h2>How do I find a Will Aid solicitor?</h2> <p>You can get the contact details of participating solicitors in your local area from the <a href=""http://www.willaid.org.uk/"">Will Aid website</a>.</p> <p>Once you have chosen a solicitor, we advise you to make an appointment as soon as possible, as some solicitors get very busy in November. </p> <h2>How much should I donate?</h2> <p>The suggested minimum donation is £85 for a basic single will or £125 for a pair of basic mirror wills that you make with your spouse or partner. </p> <ul> <li>£125 could buy a camel for a family in Ethiopia, so they can have milk even in a drought</li> <li>£85 could provide a bicycle for a community health worker, so more children get vital help.</li></ul> <p>You can give your donation to your solicitor, and they will pass it on to Will Aid. Alternatively, you can make a direct donation from the Will Aid website.</p> <h2>What do I need to do next?</h2> <p>For a step-by-step guide on how to write your will, read <a href=""/en/docs/Guide-to-making-a-will.pdf"">our simple guide to making a will</a> (PDF 1.1MB).</p> <div style=""BORDER-RIGHT: #666666 1px solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5px; BORDER-TOP: #666666 1px solid; DISPLAY: block; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #666666 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 5px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #666666 1px solid""> <h2>Will Aid works</h2> <p>Mr and Mrs Norman chose to use the Will Aid service. “It was very easy to find the nearest Will Aid solicitor on the website,” said Mrs Norman. “The solicitor was very professional during the meeting and gave us a clear explanation of the different options available to us.”</p> <p>Mrs Norman was delighted that some of their donation to Will Aid went to Save the Children, a charity close to their heart. “Many children in the world have very little, and not even enough to eat in many cases,” she said. “We wanted to help children as they are the future generation.”</p></div> <p style=""font-size: 120%; background-color: #894; font-family: GillSansWBbold, arial; padding: 4px""><span>Contact the legacies team on:</span> <span style=""color: #fff"">020 7012 6400</span></p>"

This is why our team in London decided to join Save the Children’s Take a Step challenge last month.</p> <p>On 21st October, we asked faculty and staff at the London campus to pick the colleagues they thought would take the most steps between 9am and 5pm over three working days. With our top four nominees selected, we armed each of them with a pedometer provided by Save the Children and asked everyone to ‘bet’ on an overall winner, with all bets becoming donations to the charity. </p> <p>The three-day challenge took place from 26th to 28th October 2010. With the entire School behind them, our four walkers took an impressive 86,729 steps between them. The overall winner of the challenge was Maria, our Events and Programme Office Assistant. </p> <p>She took an incredible 30,954 of those steps herself, coming in way ahead of the nearest competitor. ESCP Europe’s London campus is delighted to announce that a total of £625.20 was raised for Save the Children over three days. We would like to thank all our staff for their generosity, not to mention our four walkers! <p><img height=320 src=""/sites/default/files/ESCP_Europe_Take_a_Step1.JPG"" width=482></p> <p><strong>Lanka Challenge</strong> <br>This consists of racing a tuk-tuk 1,500km around Sri Lanka. Save the Children supporters Jonathon, Nigel and Harry, team name 'Trinco & Back', competed against 27 other teams over a route that took them from the capital, Colombo, to Trincomalee in the North East down the East coast to the Yala National Park, up into the hills of the tea country, downhill to Kandy and the Temple of the Tooth, and, finally, back to Colombo. </p> <p>The team drove a tuk-tuk for 10 days and came 14th and carried off the prize for the largest amount raised for charity. En route the team camped in the jungle with a stone-age tribe, staying in very basic accommodation and being eaten by tropical insects.</p> <p>Here is a quote from the team...

It’s perfect for the start of the new school year, the end of term, or for over summer. Many schools and groups get involved during anti-bullying week in November.</P><strong> <h2>Who can take part?</h2> <p></strong>Anyone can take part in Friendship Funday. Primary and secondary schools, scouts, girl guides, youth groups – everyone is invited to celebrate friendship and raise funds for our work! </P> <p>Look at the Friendship Funday <a href=""http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/assets/php/google-map.php"">Community Map</a> to see other schools or groups taking part near you.</p><strong> <h2>Why get involved?</h2></strong> <p>Every year, nearly 9 million children die before they reach their fifth birthday. Most could have been saved, because they die from hunger, or diseases that could have been prevented or treated, like malaria or diarrhoea. </p> <p>Your donations from Friendship Funday will help us give children the food and water, healthcare, safety and education they need to thrive. </p> <p>Taking part in Friendship Funday directly supports key elements of the UK school curriculum, as well as scouting and guiding programmes.

Families have lost their incomes and food supplies. Millions of children are hungry, thirsty and desperate. They are in danger of becoming critically malnourished and, without help, many in the worst hit areas could die. </p> <p>Save the Children is already on the ground saving lives. We’re providing food, water, medicine and crucial support to families who have lost their incomes. </p> <p>With your help we can stop this crisis becoming far worse. These children don’t have to die – but to save them we need your help to act now. </p> <p><a href=""/what-we-do/emergencies/east-africa-appeal"">Please donate to our East Africa Appeal</a>  </p> <h2>Why is this happening?</h2> <p>The expected rains across large areas of the region (including north-east Kenya and large parts of Somalia) have failed, leading to widespread devastation of farmland, failed harvests and livestock deaths – up to 60% of cattle have perished in some areas. Families have lost their crops, livestock, and food supplies. </p> <p>Food and water prices have soared. Families are struggling to get even one meal a day. </p> <p>Thousands of children across the region face starvation. And those who survive can be damaged for life by lack of food when they’re little. </p> <p>Thousands of families, including around 70,000 children, have been forced to flee their drought-stricken homes to survive, with many joining overcrowded refugee camps.</p> <h2>Our response</h2> <p>Save the Children was already on the ground and able to respond quickly. But we urgently need funds to save many more children’s lives, and to stop the crisis getting even worse. </p> <ul> <li>We're distributing life-saving water to areas severely affected by the drought, and improving water supply and sanitation facilities in health clinics and schools. For example, we’ve distributed over 24 million litres of water in south central Somalia, reaching more than 70,000 people. </li> <li>We're providing jerry cans, water filters and water purification tablets to ensure that water is safe to drink. </li> <li>We're treating malnourished children. The life-saving treatment is usually quick and simple – so far this year, we've treated more than 8,000 malnourished children in our feeding centres in Somalia. </li></ul> <h2>How you can help</h2> <p><a href=""/what-we-do/emergencies/east-africa-appeal"">Please donate to our East Africa Appeal</a> </p> <h2>The longer term</h2> <p>We're helping families break the cycle of drought and hunger. </p> <p>We were already working in the region, and saw the early warning signs that the drought was coming. So we’ve been able to respond very quickly and save many lives as a result. </p> <p>But the scale of the crisis demands that we and other aid agencies go further to get support to all those who need it. </p> <p>In Kenya we’ve been working with communities to prepare for this drought – for example in Mandera (a heavily affected region) we have been giving 12,000 families cash to help build their resilience to the coming drought. </p> <p>That’s 12,000 people who are significantly less likely to fall into food crisis now. </p> <p>We don’t want to create dependency on food aid, so we’re working to respond to the immediate needs and long term needs in a sustainable way. </p> <p>We’ve changed the traditional food aid package – transferring food distributions to local traders instead of aid organisations, and then substituting part of the imported food aid with local, fresh, healthy produce. In doing so, we are helping the local market, local traders and local communities to flourish. </p> <ul> <li>It’s working – our data shows that people participating in the scheme are eating more frequently (an additional meal a day), and their food supply is lasting several days more. </li> <li>Traders have seen an increase in their incomes (by 28%). </li> <li>Families say the system is more dignified, and healthier. It’s sustainable, and empowers communities, and increases resilience. </li> <li>We've scaled up the scheme, from 12,000 people per month to reaching 40,560 people now.   </li></ul> <p><a href=""/what-we-do/emergencies/east-africa-appeal"">Donate to our East Africa Appeal</a></p>"

This year's 50/50 sale event for Save the Children Week was a brilliant success. Income was up from last year. They raised a whopping £23K. We look forward to seeing what they can do in 2011!</p> <p>After more than 40 years of sale events this one was extra special. Not only was it filmed by John Thirwell from Ilkley, but students from Bedales School modelled the clothes and were captured by  photographer Michael Focard (<a href=""http://www.focard.co.uk/"">http://www.focard.co.uk/</a>). More than 100 workers over ten days were involved in the project and their hard work has really paid off.</p> <p>‘Tea at the Ritz’ was held by the Kettering branch with support from the congregation of St. Michael’s Church who provided the venue and donated cakes. Afternoon tea was served on traditional china and a pianist added to the wonderful atmosphere. Over £500 was raised at this wondeful event.</p> <p><img height=376 src=""/sites/default/files/Kettering_Tea_at_the_Ritz_photo.jpg"" width=464></p> <p></p> <p>The Balsall Common Branch had a successful house to house collection during Save the Children Week. 15 of the 53rd City of Coventry Berkswell Beavers were put in groups with adults and explained how they were raising money for Save the Children Week.

All shoppers needed to do was tick a box at checkout to make the donation to Save the Children during our charity week.

I combine my Save the Children activities with my role as Associate Dean and Head of Department of Management, Leadership and Organisation at the University of Hertfordshire Business School. </p> <p>During this academic year groups of our students have worked with Save the Children on a variety of projects .The students have thoroughly enjoyed the experience and have proposed some good ideas. We are hoping to engage students in the next academic year in another group of projects. </p> <p>My involvement with Volunteer Advisory Group is really my first experience at Headquarters and we have been given briefings on all aspects of the work of Save the Children which I have found very useful and informative. I am also pleased that discussions at VAG have led to positive changes for the organisation particularly in relation to volunteer activities. </p> <p>As the only male on the group I sometimes find this to be a particular challenge! I have been really pleased to have been given the opportunity to contribute at a national level and look forward to continued involvement. It has also been very useful to be able to explain to my local branch why particular decisions have been made at a national level and gain useful feedback from volunteer members. </p></dd> </dl> <br class=""clear""> <dl class=""action-item""> <dd class=""image""><img src=""/sites/default/files/Barbara_VA.gif""></dd> <dt>Barbara Fulton</dt> <dd><p>I began volunteering at the Bangor Save the Children shop in November 2000. I have since become Shop Leader and I am also a member of the Save the Children Bangor branch and the volunteer forum. </p> <p>In November 2007 I joined the Volunteer Advisory Group.I enjoy contributing to and learning new ideas about Save the Children  from this group which in turn allows me to contribute more usefully at local level with a greater level of understanding of the issues between volunteers and staff.</p></dd> </dl> <br class=""clear""> <dl class=""action-item""> <dd class=""image""><img src=""/sites/default/files/Sally_VA.jpg""></dd> <dt>Sally Kuenssberg</dt> <dd><p>I have been a Trustee of Save the Children for five years and one of my current roles is to bring a ‘volunteering’ perspective to the discussions of the Board. I am also chair of the Scottish Council which supports both programme and fundraising work in Scotland.</p> <p>I was involved in the setting up of the Volunteer Advisory Group to promote effective communication between volunteers and staff and ensure that volunteers are consulted about new developments. I have enjoyed hearing the wide range of members’ views and look forward to the group’s contribution to the future development of volunteering within Save the Children.</p></dd> </dl> <br class=""clear""> <dl class=""action-item""> <dd class=""image""><img src=""/sites/default/files/Sophie_VA.gif""></dd> <dt>Sophie McCormick</dt> <dd><p>I became aware of Save the Children at junior school in the 50’s and organised my first 'event' when I was 8 years old - a garden table sale! </p> <p>I continued to support the charity and became a branch committee member in the late 80’s and through this became more actively involved in local fundraising including organising tennis tournaments. This led on to working on the national event and other roles within the organisation. </p> <p>I am very privileged to be able to work at both local and national level with community and corporate supporters and major donors and this gives me a very broad view of fundraising and volunteering. I continue to chair the Esher and District Branch, the National Tennis Tournament and I am a Vice President of Save the Children UK. </p> <p>As a member of the Volunteer Advisory Group I am able to bring various perspectives from these different areas. I am committed to exploring ways to improve and develop the volunteer experience for current and future volunteers.</p></dd> </dl> <br class=""clear""> <dl class=""action-item""> <dd class=""image""><img src=""/sites/default/files/Sue_VA.gif""></dd> <dt>Susan Nuckley</dt> <dd>I was one of the original team when the Hythe Shop opened in August 1991 and I have volunteered there ever since as a Day Leader. My young daughter sat under the sorting table in the early days (less Health & Safety then!) and my husband is also a Shop Volunteer so it has always been a family affair. Having attended a couple of Regional Conference Days I became more interested in the wider work of Save the Children and last year applied to be a Retail Advisor with the group.<br><br>Membership of the group enables me to meet Head Office staff and other volunteers, understand the issues they are facing and contribute a retail point of view.</dd> </dl> <br class=""clear""> <dl class=""action-item""> <dd class=""image""><img src=""/sites/default/files/Marilyn_VA.gif""></dd> <dt>Marilyn Payne</dt> <dd><p>I joined Save the Children about 25 years ago when I became the founder Chairman of the Faversham Branch in Kent. Since then I’ve had a number of roles including Supporter Group Co-ordinator and Speaking Out Co-ordinator. </p> <p>I originally joined Save the Children as I felt it was a good charity and I remain a volunteer because I believe passionately about our organisation and can see the real difference that our work makes to children’s lives. I especially enjoy being a member of the Volunteer Advisory Group because I feel we make a positive contribution to the strategies and policies made by the organisation and volunteers are now being respected and listened to. </p> <p>It is good to work with staff on the ‘bigger picture’ and I am particularly proud to have been on the working groups to review the Volunteer Days and the introduction of the new Speaking Out strategy. </p></dd> </dl> <br class=""clear"">"

That was the headline on a leaflet drawing attention to the plight of children on the losing side of the First World War. Save the Children's founder, Eglantyne Jebb, was arrested and fined for distributing it in Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>After the war ended, the British government kept up a blockade that left children in cities like Berlin and Vienna starving. Tuberculosis and rickets were rife.</p> <p>""The children's bones were like rubber. Clothing was utterly lacking. In the hospitals there was nothing but paper bandages."" Dr Hector Munro, Save the Children, 1919.</p> <p>Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton decided that direct action was needed as well as campaigning. The Save the Children Fund was set up at a public meeting in London's Royal Albert Hall in May 1919. From that day to this we've been raising funds to provide relief to children suffering the effects of war.</p> <p><a href=""#backtotop"">Back to top</a></p><a name=EARLYYEARS></a> <h2>The early years: fight the famine</h2> <p>""Thousands of people . . . tired, sick and hungry. I had to carry my youngest brother. One day I saw that he was not moving or crying for bread any more. I showed him to my mother and she saw that he was dead. We were glad that he was dead because we had nothing to feed him on."" Armenian refugee child, 1921</p> <p>Fight the Famine raised money very quickly. Single donations ranged from two shillings to £10,000. It gave the money to organisations working with children in Germany, Austria, France, Belgium, the Balkans and Hungary and for Armenian refugees in Turkey.</p> <p>Save the Children was not expected to be a permanent organisation, but it was called on to deal with emergency after emergency.</p> <p>The organisers used a range of media to raise money, including:</p> <ul> <li>page-length advertisements in national newspapers </li> <li>film footage of famine and disaster work in operation.</li></ul> <p>Dorothy become less involved with Save the Children to concentrate on political campaigning. But the charismatic Eglantyne Jebb, honorary secretary, was a force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>Eglantyne was persuasive and committed, and her ideas about children's welfare were well ahead of her time. </p> <p>Under her leadership, Save the Children quickly became known as a highly effective relief agency, able to provide food, clothing and money quickly and inexpensively. For example, during the 1921 famine in Russia, the organisation was able to mount an operation to feed 650,000 people - for a shilling per person per week.</p> <p><a href=""#backtotop"">Back to top</a></p><a name=1920></a> <h2>1920s - children's rights</h2> <p>""I believe we should claim certain rights for the children and labour for their universal recognition, so that everybody - not merely the small number of people who are in a position to contribute to relief funds, but everybody who in any way comes into contact with children, that is to say the vast majority of mankind - may be in a position to help forward the movement."" Eglantyne Jebb </p> <p>Eglantyne Jebb wanted to make the rights and welfare of children a major issue around the world. Her 'Declaration of the Rights of the Child' was adopted by the League of Nations and inspired the present UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p> <p>After 1923, with fewer emergencies to deal with, Save the Children focused on research and children's-rights projects. In the UK, we: </p> <ul> <li>opened a recuperative school at Fairfield House in Kent for children from inner-city areas </li> <li>helped young miners' families in poverty-striken areas in Wales and Cornwall. </li></ul> <p>In Hungary, we supported a school based on the principle of co-operation and children having a say in the running of the school.</p> <p><a href=""#backtotop"">Back to top</a></p><a name=1930></a> <h2>1930s - a growing organisation</h2> <p>""If we accept our premise, that the Save the Children Fund must work for its own extinction, it must seek to abolish, for good and for all, the poverty which makes children suffer and stunts the race of which they are the parents. It must not be content to save children from the hardships of life - it must abolish these hardships; nor think it suffices to save them from immediate menace - it must place in their hands the means of saving themselves and so of saving the world."" Eglantyne Jebb</p> <p>Eglantyne Jebb died in 1928. Her ambition had been to extend the work of Save the Children outside Europe, and we went on to:</p> <ul> <li>establish the Child Protection Committee, which lobbied for the rights of children in Africa and Asia throughout the decade </li> <li>set up a nursery school in Addis Ababa in 1936 </li> <li>set up nursery schools in several depressed areas in the UK, including the first nursery school in Wales.</li></ul> <p>Our 1933 research report Unemployment and the Child: An Enquiry showed that mass unemployment affects children's nutrition. We campaigned for children's right to adequate nutrition until the Education Act of 1944 provided school meals and milk throughout the UK. </p> <p>We worked with refugees from the Spanish Civil War and were part of the Inter Aid committee that organised the Kinderstransports of Jewish refugees.</p> <p><a href=""#backtotop"">Back to top</a></p><a name=1940></a> <h2>1940s - another war</h2> <p>""Thirty vagrant children who had escaped from the Warsaw ghetto were publicly drowned in a pool at the Glymianski brickworks...The only place where the Jewish children of Warsaw can see grass and trees is the cemetery."" Children in Bondage, 1943</p> <p>During the Second World War we were forced to withdraw from projects in occupied Europe.</p> <p>In the UK, we set up:</p> <ul> <li>residential nurseries for young children who had been evacuated from the cities </li> <li>day nurseries for children whose parents were working in wartime industries </li> <li>playcentres in air-raid shelters in large cities </li> <li>junior clubs for older children who often played unsupervised on bombsites </li> <li>Hopscotch - the first playgroup in the UK and the start of a major area of work for many years.</li></ul> <p>Save the Children started planning for overseas post-war work in 1942 by publishing the report Children in Bondage.

Stephen Peet, director of A Far Cry, 1958</p> <p>By the 1950s there were still many displaced families and Save the Children continued working in Germany, Austria, Italy and Greece. It sent extra teams to Austria in 1956 to help Hungarian refugees fleeing after the failed revolution.</p> <p>Outside Europe, the Serendah project gave orphaned boys an education, training and a safe place to live in Malaya. Save the Children tried to set up projects in Nigeria and Sudan, but failed. Work in Somaliland, Syria and Lebanon was more successful.</p> <p>The Korean War began in 1950. Two years later the first Save the Children workers arrived. They stayed for more than 20 years. Many children were left destitute by the war, living unaccompanied on the streets. Malnutrition and associated diseases were rife. </p> <p>In 1959, Save the Children and Oxfam produced the film A Far Cry, which showed how far Korean children were from basic housing, food, education and healthcare. The BBC showed the film on Easter Sunday that year.</p> <p>By the end of the 1950s, most of the organisation's money was going towards work in Asia.</p> <p>Save the Children is non-political and non-sectarian, and has a philosophy of international co-operation. But international politics affect the organisation.</p> <ul> <li>The Iron Curtain compelled it to withdraw from some areas in post-war Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Yugoslavia and Hungary. </li> <li>It was forced to withdraw from some areas in the Middle East following the Suez crisis in 1956.</li></ul> <p><a href=""#backtotop"">Back to top</a></p><a name=1960></a> <h2>1960s - the development decade</h2> <p>The Fund now had full medical and welfare teams in 17 countries and its total help, including that in Great Britain, extended to 26 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the West Indies.

Something very bad was happening.” </p> <p>Ziaullah describes the terrifying floods that swept through his home in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. The people here are accustomed to coping with floods but nobody was prepared for this – the most severe deluge in living memory, which destroyed homes and devastated crops, turning life upside-down for as many as 21 million people. </p> <p>“Soon the water had reached the bottom of our house.” When the water finally flooded into Ziaullah’s house, they had to leave, Ziaullah explains. “My father was out at the time. All the women and children were crying.” </p> <p>“Everything was gone”</p> <p>The extent of the damage was only discovered in the following days: </p> <p>“After three days my father went back to see our house. When he returned he told me everything was fine, and not to worry. Once the waters had calmed down, my father took me back to where our house was and it was gone. Everything was gone. I couldn’t believe it. The house where I grew up was completely gone.”</p> <p>Ziaullah and his family went to stay with an aunt, but conditions were so crowded that they were soon forced to leave. Since then, they’ve been living in a camp nearby.</p> <p>“At night we go to our grandmother’s house. We can’t sleep in the tent camp – if it rains all the water comes into the tent. We don’t have any blankets or pillows so we have a very tough time. I don’t like this life at all. I wish my family could have our house back.”</p> <h2>A place to play and hope</h2> <p>Times are tough for Ziaullah and his family but we’re helping him get back a sense of normality.</p> <p>“Today some children came to our camp and told us that there was a centre where children could come and play. It was better for us to go there than to stay in the camp doing nothing all day.”</p> <p>Our safe play spaces are safe, clean supervised places for children to find much-needed relief in the aftermath of disasters. Our staff let children lead their own play and learning here, to give them back a sense of control, and support them emotionally to cope with what can be traumatic hardship..</p> <p>“We went to this centre and I was really happy there because I found all the games that I used to play before the flood. I like playing with my friends there. I like to play cricket. I like to play badminton. And I like to play football.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Save the Children is running eight child-protection centres and 10 safe spaces in Swat and we’ll soon be opening eight new protection and nutrition centres.

Before he was born she had three miscarriages. Then her daughter died before she was one year old. When our health project started in her area she finally found out why.","<img id=""image-10830"" alt=""Shahira and Hazim in Egypt"" title="""" src=""/sites/default/files/470x310.jpg"" width=""470"" height=""310""> <p>When Shahira’s first pregnancy failed, she didn’t understand what was happening. “My mother-in-law and my neighbours told me I’d had a miscarriage,” she says. “They told me it was my fault for not resting. I believed them.”</p> <p>After her third miscarriage Shahira felt tired and weak. “My mother-in-law told me the family needed children. I wanted to have a break but she told me I must keep trying.” </p> <p>Shahira became pregnant with her fourth child and, at four months, was told at the health centre that everything was fine. </p> <h2>A glimpse of joy</h2> <p>“I gave birth at home with a traditional birth attendant and I was very happy to have a baby girl. But she was very small, too small. </p> <p>“I started breastfeeding, everyone said to feed her a lot and she’d get bigger. At three months my mother-in-law started to feed her other food too, she said my milk wasn’t enough. She grew, her face was beautiful but her body was still too small. One day I saw her face started turning blue. We rushed her to the hospital, but on the way she passed away. </p> <p>“I took a long time in mourning, I was so sad. I held this little girl, she waved at me – it was a very difficult time for me. </p> <p>“The health centre didn’t give me enough care, but the private clinic was too expensive for my husband to afford.</p> <p>“A year after our daughter died I was pregnant again. I did the test and then I heard an announcement at the mosque that there were free medical check-ups for pregnant women from an NGO [Save the Children] at the health centre. I wasn’t motivated to go because of my previous experience there. But my neighbour told me it was better and that I should go. </p> <h2>Change for good</h2> <p>“I couldn’t believe it was the same health centre, everyone was supportive and caring. It was the first time I’d had a lab analysis. The doctor tested my blood and my urine and told me I needed to go to the government hospital for further tests. No one had ever suggested I do tests to check why I was having miscarriages. They told me I had a disease [toxoplasmosis, a parasitic blood disease that can come from contact with cat faeces or raw meat] and that it had affected my babies. I needed a vaccine and drugs to keep my baby. The blood test also showed my blood had trouble clotting. I always used to bleed a lot.</p> <h2>Growing courage</h2> <p>“I no longer felt so afraid. The health centre had been asleep, but now the staff and volunteers were motivated. They have classes, one for pregnant women every week. I wanted to know everything. They explained the issues and risks – what to do and not to do. I didn’t know any of this before.</p> <p>“I had my son at the hospital in Minia. I insisted on going. I insisted to my mother-in-law because she was against it. With new courage I told her I’d decided. When she started to argue I told her I’d listened to her for all those years and lost my babies.</p> <p>“When my baby boy was delivered the doctor told me he was healthy and had a good weight. I was so happy. Everything I knew, I learned from those classes. He’s three years old now. I want to thank you for helping me to have such a healthy child.”</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p>Read more about <a href=""/where-we-work/middle-east/egypt"">our work in Egypt </a>and our campaign to save <a href=""/get-involved/every-one"">EVERY ONE</a> of the 8.8 million children who die every year from illnesses that could be treated or prevented.<br></p>"

Most of their deaths could have been prevented. But the reality is that not every child has an equal chance of survival. Children from the poorest communities are most likely to die.</p><img class=image-right title="""" style=""MARGIN-LEFT: 40px"" alt=""Not every child has an equal chance of survival"" src=""/sites/default/files/quote-every-child.gif""> <p>A small number of diseases and conditions are the biggest killers of young children today. Pneumonia, measles, diarrhoea, malaria, HIV and AIDS and complications during pregnancy and after birth cause more than 90% of deaths in children under five. Children who are malnourished are at far greater risk of dying from these causes because they're too weak to fight disease.</p> <object height=285 width=470><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/GJ7TePZkebk&hl=en&fs=1&""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""> <embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/GJ7TePZkebk&hl=en&fs=1&"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""470"" height=""285""></embed></OBJECT> <p style=""MARGIN-TOP: 15px"">Proven, low-tech and inexpensive solutions exist to stop children dying.

What we need is the will – from politicians, the public, aid agencies, companies, EVERY ONE – to make it happen on a global scale.</p> <p style=""MARGIN-TOP: 15px"">We are working with people across the world to ensure that every child will have the chance to live past their fifth birthday. From Niger to Nottingham, Sheffield to Sierra Leone. We are working together and for every child to make sure that world leaders keep their promise and that every child has a right to life. </p> <h2>What needs to change</h2> <p>In 2000, world leaders came together and promised to cut the number of children under five who die and maternal mortality by 75% by 2015. These still remain to be the most off track promises made by world leaders to date. We are putting pressure on the coalition government to ensure these promises get back on track at the United Nations (UN) Poverty Summit in September and you can be a part of making that happen. We can do it – but only if we act now.</p> <h2>What is Save the Children doing?</h2> <ul> <li>We are collecting 100,000 thumbprints to present to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, as a petition asking him to take a leadership role at the UN Poverty Summit this September </li> <li>We are mobilising 60 million people all over the world – in rich and poor countries – to push their governments to act </li> <li>We are inspiring EVERYONE to press for change across the world, ensuring 9 million children are saved </li> <li>We are calling upon the government to deliver a strong action plan for reducing under-5 child deaths and child mortality at the United Nations (UN) Summit in September </li> <li>We are doubling our investment in our child survival programmes to help reach 50 million women and children a year by 2015 </li></ul> <h2>What you can do</h2> <p>EVERY ONE of us has a role to play in saving children’s lives. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/savethechildrenuk?v=app_141330322563413"">Join our campaign and press for change now</a>. </p> <p><a href=""http://everyone.org/"">See what EVERY ONE is doing all over the world</a></p>"

Since the Industrial Revolution humans have burned fossil fuels, releasing greenhouse emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which build up in the atmosphere, and trap heat. As their concentration increases, so do the levels of heat.</p> <p>The resulting rise in temperature of the earth's atmosphere in turn affects weather patterns. Global warming is making some places drier and some wetter, and increasing the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events like droughts, floods and cyclones.</p> <p>Climate change disrupts seasonal patterns, which can have a negative impact on crop yields. It's also creating more extreme weather patterns. Over the past two decades the number of natural disasters has doubled. More floods, cyclones and droughts means more children’s lives are at risk. </p> <h2>Impact on children potentially devastating </h2> <p>Climate change poses severe threats to child survival and wellbeing, food security and nutrition, as well as children’s access to education and protection. They will face more natural disasters as well as reduced access to water, malnutrition and changing disease patterns.  </p> <p>What’s more, some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as <a href=""/where-we-work/africa/ethiopia"">Ethiopia</a> and <a href=""/where-we-work/asia/bangladesh"">Bangladesh</a>, have significantly high numbers of children under the age of 14 years old.

The programme produces books and pamphlets with fictional letters sent to an 'agony aunt' Sissy Aminata.

The programme involves 2,263 children and young people in 49 communities in the country.</p> <p>In <strong>China</strong>, we have set up 15 children's activity centres in villages with a high prevalence of HIV, and in poverty-stricken districts of Fuyang City.

The scale of the problem is huge. The chronic form of malnutrition, known as stunting, affects 178 million children – one-third of all children under five-years old in developing countries</p> <p>Children who are stunted are shorter than average. Their brain development is also affected, which has major implications later in life on their schooling and productivity.</p> <p>From 2005, world food prices rose steadily, peaking in 2008.

We estimate that the 2007-08 food price crisis resulted in at least 4.3 million more children becoming malnourished. </p> <h2>How we can reduce hunger</h2> <p>Malnutrition primarily occurs from conception to the child’s second birthday. The growth of the baby in the mother’s womb is the first point at which the effects of poor diet are felt. A significant proportion of babies are born with low birth weight. After two years of age it’s much harder to reverse the effects of chronic malnutrition. </p> <p>So, if a pregnant woman and a baby under the age of two have access to an adequate and nutritious diet, the child’s future opportunities are greatly improved. We research and help children affected or most at risk of malnutrition, and we lobby for improved policies to combat the problem. </p> <p>Our comprehensive approach always includes a combined focus on nutrition, people’s access to food, and how they can earn a living to pay for food - particularly cash transfers - so families can be better prepared and more able to cope with natural and economic shocks.</p> <p><a href=""/what-we-do/hunger/how-we-tackle-hunger""><strong>Find out more about how we tackle hunger</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Our report </strong><a href=""/resources/online-library/hungry-for-change-an-eight-step-costed-plan-of-action-to-tackle-global-child-hunger""><strong>Hungry for Change</strong></a><strong> presents an eight-step plan of action for tackling global child hunger.</strong></p>"

Our unique approach paints an accurate picture of how households buy and produce food. It enables governments and aid agencies to predict which families are least likely to survive a disaster - like a flood, a drought or a sudden change in the local market that puts food and income-earning opportunities out of reach of poor people.</p> <p>Until the 1980s, it was generally thought that famines occurred when too little food had been produced in an area to feed the people living there. It was then shown that in fact there is usually enough food in these situations; the problem is that some people are unable to get enough of it. So, in order to predict food shortages, researchers began to look at data on how different population groups obtain food - through buying it, farming, receiving gifts, working for food rather than money, etc. However, analysis of complex sets of data was difficult and largely unsuccessful. Important information could easily be missed by outside 'experts' who typically had to decipher reams of data.</p> <h2>The Household Economy Approach</h2> <p>In the 1990s, building on 20 years of work, <strong>Save the Children developed a creative solution to predicting food shortages</strong>, the Household Economy Approach. This is a rigorous but flexible way of collecting and analysing wide ranging information and is based on households in rural areas explaining how they live and make ends meet. Through interviews with government officials, villagers and, for example, local traders, we build up a picture of the local ´household economy' - what the different population groups are, how they obtain food, how they obtain income and how they are likely to behave when food or income is scarce.  Researchers use simple techniques to get this information - for example, using piles of beans to find out from people what proportion of food and income comes from different sources (farming, gifts, fishing, market, etc) and ranking people by wealth. </p> <p>This local knowledge can then be used to identify and describe the issues facing the main 'wealth groups' and make predictions on how they will cope with specific problems. For example, when rains are delayed, tribal conflicts may limit pastoralist communities' access to water and grazing, making them more likely to have to sell cattle to buy food. With the Household Economy Approach, it is now <strong>possible to target effective aid towards the most vulnerable families and children</strong> before their circumstances become critical thereby preventing suffering and possibly death. </p> <p>The Household Economy Approach has achieved large-scale changes for children. It is now used in 23 countries. The approach has been adopted by governments in Africa, (including Malawi, southern Sudan and Lesotho) and in Ethiopia, for example, it is the main instrument used for livelihoods analysis and predicting food shortages. It is also widely used by other international organisations, including, crucially, the US-funded Famine and Early Warning Systems Network.</p> <p>In 2005/06,<strong> 23 million people in Africa - more than half of them children - received emergency aid </strong>after assessments using our approach had been carried out.</p> <p>While the Household Economy Approach (HEA) has mainly been used to predict famine, it is also an invaluable tool for obtaining critical information in a number of other settings. Rapid HEA, for example, is an extremely useful and cost effective version adapted for emergency situations in small areas. When used after the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005, the assessment took only two weeks, and cost under £13,000. From this, we raised nearly £1m, enabling us to get help to more than 15,000 children who desperately needed it. The Household Economy Approach also helps us understand the roles children play to help their families - doing things like fishing, herding animals or caring for younger siblings. This kind of information about family roles helps governments make policies that support households and that also promote children's right to education, play and free time. </p> <p><a href=""/resources/online-library/the-household-economy-approach-a-guide-for-programme-planners-and-policy-makers"">The Household Economy Approach: A guide for programme planners and policy-makers </a><br></p> <h2>Lenda Lera's story</h2> <p>Lenda Lera, a 35-year-old father of six, is preparing his land. He plans to leave for Arba Minch after he finishes sowing maize and sweet potato. Lenda hopes to find work there as a daily labourer on one of the state farms that grow cotton. While his wife and children look after the fields, he will earn some money to buy food until the next harvest.</p> <p>HEA assessments show that Lenda, and people in similar situations in his area, face acute food shortages if the sweet potato crop fails, or the maize harvest is delayed. He is susceptible to rises in food prices, and will struggle if there is not enough work on farms in neighbouring areas, or if wages are low. Lenda would benefit from a sales cooperative through which he could sell his produce in larger markets outside his area. Improved seeds and fertiliser would also result in better harvests, helping him to be more self-sufficient, and allowing him to spend less on staple foods. </p> <p>Adapted from: The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. </p> <h2>Myth-busting!</h2> <p>Several myths have abounded about rural African livelihoods for many years. One of these common myths is that most rural African families grow the majority of the food that they eat on their farms. HEA has consistently busted this myth from Swaziland to Ethiopia or Sudan by exposing the fact that typically poor families grow only a small proportion - between 20-35 per cent of the food they eat annually. In fact most rural Africans purchase at least 50 per cent of the food they eat from traders, local shops and relatives and they spend much of their time doing casual labour for other local families or receiving money from relatives working elsewhere.</p> <p>Reference: Alex Rees, Livelihoods Capacity Building Adviser, Save the Children </p>"

Is it getting worse in other countries? </h3> <p>Save the Children's new Child Development Index is the world's first and only tool to answer these questions. It combines each country's performance in three areas specific to children, to produce a score on a scale of 0 to 100. We have measured child well-being over 3 peiods from 1990. Japan is in first place, scoring just 0.4. Niger in Africa is in 137th place, with the highest score, 58, in 2000-2006.</p> <p>Overall, child well-being as improved by 34% since 1990, but progress is slow. Leaders must consider how children are doing and how their decisions impact them.

Africa scores 35 in the Index, reflecting the high level of deprivation in primary schooling, child health and child nutrition. It is also making the slowest progress, improving child well-being by only 20% over 1990-2006. </p> <p>However, progress has been very mixed; some countries in Africa have done incredibly well, while others did spectacularly badly. Countries like Malawi cut child deprivation in half, enrolling more than 90% of primary school children. But some of the poorest children in Africa live in countries suffering from conflict and poor governance; such as Zimbabwe, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Slow progress in reducing child mortality and malnutrition is a particular problem; one in six babies born in Africa will not live to see their ffth birthday. Rich and poor countries worldwide must urgently choose to tackle this problem.</p> <h3>East Asia</h3> <p>East Asia has made considerable progress in child well-being in recent years, improving it by 45% over 1990-2006, reducing deprivation to a score of just 8.5; only one other developing region, Latin America, scores better. It has the best level of primary school enrolment and has managed to halve its child mortality rate over 1990-2006. Much of this progress is because of China’s significant improvement, where almost two-thirds of the region’s children live. China has made tremendous progress in increasing people’s incomes; nonetheless 417,000 children under the age of 5 years still died in China in 2006 alone. Countries like Malaysia and Thailand did even better in all 3 of the areas our Index measures. But, as in other regions of the world, government policy plays an important role in children's lives. For example, Myanmar saw almost no improvement at all. And in many countries, the poorest, most isolated groups are being left behind.</p> <h3>South Asia</h3> <p>South Asia has a high level of deprivation, scoring 26.4; this is 3 times worse than East Asia. It is also making slow progress, improving child well-being by just 32% over 1990-2006 (compared to East Asia’s 45% improvement). This is because India (where almost three-quarters of the region’s children live) made the least progress of any country in South Asia; just a 27% improvement. In this region, child nutrition is a substantial obstacle; almost 1 in 2 children is underweight. Malnutrition levels are not being reduced rapidly enough; the region’s enrolment indicator improved by 59% while its nutrition indicator improved by only 14%. Higher levels of economic growth in the region are not widely translating into reduced child deprivation.</p> <h3>Latin America and the Caribbean</h3> <p>The region made substantial progress in improving child well-being in the 1990s, scoring 6.8 in our index of child deprivation, the lowest of any developing country region. It made the most percentage improvement of any region in the world, reducing child deprivation by 57% over the period, 1990-2006. This improvement was largely driven by reductions in child mortality and increases in primary school enrolment. The region’s child mortality rate is now the lowest of any developing region. The region’s poorer countries, like Peru and El Salvador, have started to catch-up with the levels of child well-being seen in better-off countries in the region.</p> <h3>East and North Africa</h3> <p>The Middle East and North Africa region scores 11.2 in our index, worse than East Asia but only a third as bad as Sub-Saharan Africa, and has reduced its level of child deprivation by 41% over 1990-06. However, there is considerable variation within the region. Yemen is doing poorly, with a large increase in malnutrition over the period. And in several countries, such as Djibouti and Jordan, progress has stalled in some areas. In addition, the region includes Iraq, Lebanon, and the occupied Palestinian territory where child deprivation has increased. In contrast, several large countries such as Morocco, Egypt and Algeria have made substantial improvements. Again, little improvement has been made in reducing child malnutrition in the region as a whole.</p> <h3>Central & Eastern Europe and Central Asia</h3> <p>The region containing Central & Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, for which data are much sparser in the early 1990s, saw an improvement of almost 15% in its Index score between 1995-99 and 2000-06. Its score stands at 9.2, slightly worse than East Asia and slightly better than the Middle East and North Africa. Turkey, with a large child population, made the most progress in the region, reducing its score from 20 in the early 1990s to 7 for 2000-06.</p> <h3>Developed countries</h3> <p>Our Child Development Index shows that there is a low level of deprivation in developed countries in the three basic areas of child rights that it measures. On our scale of 0-100, these countries score 2.1, the lowest regional Index score worldwide. There is still some variation between these countries however; for example the United States has a child mortality rate that is twice of Japan’s and worse even than that of Cuba’s.</p>"

The government's Warm Home Discount Scheme will offer rebates to some, but not all those who need it.</p> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/poverty-premium-chart.png""></p> <h2>Around 20% is the rising cost of gas and electricity </h2> <p>Average bills for poorer families are £1,134 per year, compared with £881 for wealthier families (before the latest hikes in heating prices are even taken into account). It's feared that by 2020, the energy poverty premium could be as much as £1,800 per year.</p> <h2>Many parents have to choose between a hot meal or heating </h2> <p>Cold living conditions increase children’s susceptibility to illness and damages respiratory health. Education is also affected if there is no warm, peaceful space to do homework.</p> <p>“You have to prioritise heating because you have to have the house warm enough for kids.” Lana, mum of two.</p> <h2>The government Warm Home Discount scheme leaves the poorest out in the cold<br><br></h2>Sally Copley, Head of UK Policy, Save the Children, said: “The decision by the government on who should get help with their fuel bills has left the UK's poorest families out in the cold.  While we welcome the decision to help vulnerable pensioners, we are deeply concerned that the UK's poorest families have not been automatically awarded the rebate. Whether or not they get it is now in the hands of the fuel companies.” <h2>Stop the UK poverty rip-off  </h2> <p>The <a href=""http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/Consultations/warm-home-discount/1307-gov-response-warm-homes-disc-cons.pdf"">Warm Home Discount consultation</a> was an opportunity for the government to help the poorest families get a fairer deal on their fuel bills. The government could have taken the opportunity to extend a new rebate worth £120 per year to the poorest families - which would have been a lifeline for families in desperate need of any help they can get to provide a warm home for their children. Research shows that respiratory problems are more than twice as likely in children who live for three years or longer in homes that are not heated properly. </p> <h2>A review of fuel poverty </h2> <p>Fuel poverty is defined as a household spending more than 10% of its income on fuel to maintain a warm home (usually 21 degrees for the main living area, and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms).

By the time they reach GCSEs, children from poor families do half as well as their better off classmates (27% of children from poor families get 5 or more good GCSE passes, compared with 55% from better off families). </p> <p>That’s why we're working in partnership with Families and Schools Together (FAST), an award-winning, project that supports parents in improving their children’s learning and development at home, so they can reach full potential at school.</p> <p>Find out more about <a href=""/where-we-work/united-kingdom/fast"">FAST</a>. </p> <h2>Education in emergencies</h2> <p>Children always tell us the same thing in emergency situations – what they want most of all is to get back to school.

Last year she was crowned teenage samba queen. All this would change, she says, if people found out she was HIV positive.<br> <br>“At school we have a teacher who says people with HIV have a knife hanging over their heads that could drop at any time. He tells people that they can become infected just by touching a person who has HIV. My mum’s so scared people will find out, she makes me promise not to tell anyone – she says my life wouldn’t be worth living.”</p> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/RS21947_small.jpg""></p> <p>The only place teenagers like Gabriela can be honest about their HIV status is at Pela Vidda, a centre supported by Save the Children in Niteroi, on the outskirts of Rio. </p> <h3>The project</h3> <p>Around 150 children aged 6-18 now come to the centre, which was founded in 1991 to campaign for better treatment for people living with HIV. </p> <p>The project works hand-in-hand with paediatricians at Niteroi hospital to make sure the children get the treatment they need. More than that, it provides refuge, counselling, music workshops, art therapy and regular meals – and it gives them a place to talk to each other openly without fear.</p> <p>“People need to realise that those with HIV are normal just like them,” says Gabriela. “Lots of people live with illness. My mum won’t understand, but when I’m 18 I’m going to try and start telling people. I don’t want to live my life hiding away, that’s not who I am. I like being me.”</p> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/RS21980_small.jpg""></p> <h3>Rebuilding confidence</h3> <p>“The stigma and social isolation of being HIV positive hits young people particularly hard,” explains Leila Chagas, resident psychotherapist at Pela Vidda. “We know of people being excluded from their communities, even threatened or abused. [But] the difference we see in the children who come to us is amazing; just having this kind of support network transforms their view of themselves.” </p> <p>“There’s such ignorance around HIV and AIDS,” says 17-year-old Rafael, who contracted HIV from his mother. When she breastfed his younger brother, she gave breast milk to Rafael too, because they couldn’t afford decent food. Both his mother and brother have since died because of the virus.</p> <p>“I used to always be afraid my friends would discover I was HIV positive because where I live, bad things have happened to people who have it. You can feel like you’re totally alone. A few years ago I did think about killing myself. I don’t have a mum or a brother because of this disease and I felt like I was just waiting to die as well. </p> <p>""Now I feel like that’s in the past. There's a group of kids I've grown up with at the hospital and at Pela Vidda and we're all HIV positive, so it's like having a family. We’re all like brothers and sisters to each other.”</p> <h3>The future generation</h3> <p>The young people at Pela Vidda have set up peer mentoring schemes and awareness seminars. They’ll talk to other young people in hospitals and HIV projects around Rio about issues like safe sex, building friendship, and health and nutrition. <p>Rafael has now started to tell his best friends and some teachers he’s HIV positive. He also told his girlfriend, who he’s been with for one year. “She was completely cool about it. We love each other and she said the important thing was to be honest,” he says. <p>“It’s not like I’m ready to go around shouting about it, but I feel like I'm changing every year and one day I want to tell more people. Maybe in the future it’ll be my job to tell other people who are HIV positive that they don't have to pretend any more.” <p>Read more about <a href=""/where-we-work/south-america/brazil"">our work in Brazil</a>.<br><br></p>"

Why do children need protecting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)?</h2> <p>Children in the DRC are in grave danger. The conflict in the DRC has a terrible history of <a title=""Schoolchildren seized in Congo"" href=""/news/schoolchildren-seized-as-congo-armed-groups-recruit-child-soldiers"">children being kidnapped and forced to serve with rebel forces</a>. </p> <p>Before the violence escalated we believe over 3,000 children were fighting with rebel groups. Now there are many, many more. </p> <p>As well as abduction, children are at risk from:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Displacement</strong>. It’s estimated over 1.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting. </li> <li><strong>Separation </strong>from their families, making them more vulnerable to rebel forces. </li> <li><strong>Violence</strong> and <strong>abuse</strong>. There are reports that soldiers from both sides use mass rape as a weapon. </li> <li><strong>Witnessing traumatic events</strong>. Even if children manage to escape all of the above, they could witness horrific occurrences.  </li></ul> <h2>2. How does Save the Children locate vulnerable children in a conflict situation like this?</h2> <p>We’ve been working in the DRC since 1994. Our work includes identifying separated and unaccompanied vulnerable children, and demobilising children forced to join rebel groups. In the last year we helped 2,200 children out of armed groups, and reunited most of them with their families.</p> <p>We use networks within communities to identify children who are unaccompanied. We also work with families, educating them on how to stay together in an emergency situation.</p> <p>When a conflict arises, we’re there to identify and protect children in displaced persons camps. Once a child has been identified (or brought to our attention) we will ‘rapidly register’ the child. That means we’ll talk to them, and get as many details as we can in order to start tracing their family members. This important process also helps the child to feel more safe and secure.</p> <p>We’re leaders in the family tracing processes. Our systems and recommendations have been adopted by humanitarian organisations across the world. Family tracing involves taking all the details the child (or those around them) have given to us, and – using an image of the child – sending teams out to their communities to begin tracking down the known whereabouts of the child’s relatives. As you can imagine, it’s a phenomenally tough task. After the Rwandan genocide in the 1990’s, we reunited 45,000 families. </p> <h2>3. What does Save the Children do to protect children in the DRC?</h2> <p>Because we’ve been working in the DRC since 1994, we’ve established strong community links, and we’ve set up a network of foster families.</p> <p>Our first priority is to make sure that separated and unaccompanied children are safe where they are. Sometimes they’re staying with other families from their communities, and we’ll make sure they’re ok to stay there while we trace their families.</p> <p>If we think they need to be moved, we’ll place them with one of our foster families. These families receive support from us to look after the children. If they’re in a camp, they’ll have lost all of their belongings, so Save the Children provides them with the support they need to look after their own children, and separated or unaccompanied children. </p> <h2>4. What happens to the children?</h2> <p>We make sure the child is safe, and staying with one of our families, someone from their community, or a relative. One of our teams will monitor the family, making sure they have enough support, and that the child is safe there. In the meantime, another team will carry out the task of family tracing. We’ll search high and low until we’ve found their parents, a relative, or exhausted all our leads.</p> <p>If we find their parents, or a relative, we’ll work towards reunifying the family, and monitor the process to make sure the child stays safe. If we can’t find any relatives, we’ll look at more long-term solutions for the child’s care. This whole process includes all sorts of checks to make sure that that the child is reunited carefully with their rightful relatives. </p> <p>The current situation in the DRC means we need to massively scale up our protection and reunification work. Families have been torn apart by the conflict, and children are sleeping on roads alone, with no food. We need your help to save these children from terrifying situations that no child should have to experience.

She was unable to get him to the health centre located a two-hours’ walk away in time to get him the medical help he desperately needed.

Having to be carried in a hammock over uneven roads can cause problems for both women and their babies, and assistance is far from guaranteed as fellow villagers often don’t want to run the risk of being soaked in the rain and getting sick, or can’t afford to miss a day’s pay.</p> <h2>“The end of a nightmare”</h2> <p>Since Save the Children helped the Rwandan Ministry of Health build a health centre in her village in the North Province of Rwanda, Josephine has given birth to two more healthy children (pictured above). Fewer mothers and infants are now dying unnecessarily from problem births and other preventable causes. </p> <p>“Having a health centre here in Gahunga is like the end of a nightmare,” she said. “We will no longer need to walk long distances for treatment, delivery or vaccines. When our children start being sick we’ll be able to walk there, get treatment and come back home to carry on with our work. I want to reward those who helped to build it and tell them thank you for helping us to stay healthy and save our children.”</p> <p>Save the Children is now working to ensure that communities in the Burera and Gicumbi districts of Rwanda have easier access to basic healthcare services by 2012.  As well as helping with medical emergencies, local health centres mean that children are able to have regular check-ups without their parents being forced to miss a day’s work – a massive consideration given that 92% of the Rwandan population in rural areas live below the poverty line. What’s more, local health centres give women and children in rural parts of Rwanda the chance to take greater control over their own health and help their communities work to reduce HIV rates – and the number of young children who die.</p> <h2>What you can do</h2> <p>Read more about <a href=""/where-we-work/africa/rwanda"">our work in Rwanda</a>.</p> <p><a href=""/donate"">Support</a> our work.</p>"

"939","/en/16467.htm","/press/celebrities-mums-and-campaigners-want-action-from-world-leaders-as-new-report-shows-350-million-children-never-see-a-health-worker-in-their-lives","Celebrities, mums and campaigners want action from world leaders as new report shows 350 million children never see a health worker in their lives","","<p>Monday 19 September 2011</p> <p>At least 350 million children will never see a health worker in their lives, warns Save the Children in a major new report released today, No child out of reach. The shortfall of doctors and nurses around the world means millions of children are dying from easily preventable diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea. In the UK, a child will see a doctor or a nurse at least 10 times in the first five years of their lives. </p> <p>Save the Children releases this report as world leaders gather at the UN General Assembly in New York. Across the UK and the globe celebrities like Ashley Jensen, Alexis Bledel and Christy Turlington Burns have joined with mummy bloggers and well over a million campaigners, putting pressure on their leaders to take action at the UN to make sure no child dies because they can’t see a nurse or doctor.</p> <p>Christy Turlington Burns, global maternal health advocate and founder of Every Mother Counts, backed the call, saying: “It is unimaginable to go through birth and life without ever receiving the advice and support of a health worker. We know that training just one health worker could help deliver life-saving treatments and save many lives. No mother should die giving life and no child is born to die. It’s time for world leaders to close the health worker gap.”</p> <p>Ashley Jensen, well known for her roles in Ugly Betty and Extras found out how important the role is that healthworkers play during a recent trip to India with Save the Children:“Nothing quite prepares you for the sights, sounds, smells and conditions of the Sanjay Colony slum in Delhi. It will stay with me forever.  I met a mum who had lost her newborn baby just because she didn’t have a trained midwife to help her with her birth.   As a mum, I know that you want to do everything for your children and every mum wants that whether they are in Beverly Hills or the slums in Delhi.  The fact that so many women are losing children because they have no trained midwife is so wrong, but it’s happening now and it will be tomorrow. I hope world leaders remember this as they make their commitments this week in New York.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, campaigners have been doing their bit lobbying governments in all corners of the globe, including in Nigeria, Liberia, Bangladesh and in the UK. In England, a mummy blogger, Chris Mosler, who travelled to Mozambique with Save the Children reaching over 30 million earlier this year through twitter campaigning for more life-saving vaccines for children said as she packed her bags for the UN Summit: “Vaccines don’t inject themselves. I’ want Cameron to lead the way with other leaders at the UN and make sure every mum has professional help they can go to when their child gets sick.”</p> <p>The new report shows how effective a healthworker can be in stopping children from dying. A single healthworker can reach up to 5,000 children in one year with life saving treatment, and a country with enough doctors and nurses for all can increase a child’s chance of survival fivefold. Bangladesh and Nepal, both low income countries, are proof that progress is possible. Both have prioritised training health workers in local villages and communities; both have managed to reduce the number of children dying. </p> <p>Dr. Joan Shepherd, a healthworker from Sierra Leone who is speaking at a UN Event supported by Save the Children said: “Sierra Leone has a tragically high maternal mortality rate because women simply can’t reach a trained midwife or nurse. Those healthworkers that are available lack the advanced training available in other countries. It simply is not acceptable that mothers and babies are dying for no reason. With the support of the international midwifery community and renewed commitment from world leaders attending the UN Summit to fund more healthworkers, we can save more mothers and babies and stop this desperate waste of life”.  </p> <p>The report ‘No child out of reach’ says that world leaders must realise that their unmet promises on health will costs lives.

Children are five times more likely to die before their fifth birthday if they live in countries such as Nigeria, Ethiopia and Liberia - which fall below the World Health Organisation health worker threshold [2.3 health workers per 1000 people] - than children living in countries with enough health workers. </p> <p>Brendan Cox, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Save the Children said: </p> <p> “It is simply not acceptable for a child to die because a midwife or a nurse is out of reach. Training health workers is simple and inexpensive, yet their impact is immense. Hundreds of children’s lives will be saved by the vaccinations a health worker administers, or by the trained help they can give to pregnant mothers.</p> <p>“World leaders must put an end to this scandal and ensure that all children, regardless of where there are born, are able to see a health worker when they need it the most.”</p> <p>The report also shows that progress is possible with the right political will and investment. In low income countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal, greater investment in community health workers has reduced the number of children dying. Both countries are now among the few on track to meet the UN’s global goal to cut the child mortality rate by two thirds by 2015. </p> <p>Save the Children warns the health worker crisis has been caused by five key underlying issues: </p> <p>• A lack of education and training in low-income countries. In the poorest countries only a small proportion of children go to school and are able to qualify as a health worker. Medical training centres that do exist are under-resourced. 173,000 doctors are trained in Europe each year compared to just 5,100 in Africa <br><br>• Poor pay and incentives leading to brain drain. There is more money and support available for health workers in rich countries prompting many in poorer countries to leave.  81% of Liberian nurses and three quarters of Mozambican doctors work abroad. Those staying behind in poor countries face the prospect of working in an under-staffed, poorly-equipped hospital, often with huge case loads and away from their family. <br><br>• Ineffective use of health workers. The health workers that do exist are often not working in the places where they are needed the most, and many lack the skills, resources and equipment they need to save children’s lives. In many countries with high numbers of child deaths, health workers are concentrated in relatively better-off urban areas, out of the reach of children in the most remote areas. <br><br>• Chronic under-investment in health from both rich and poor countries. There is a two thirds funding shortfall for health workers. The UK currently spends 25% of its health aid on health workers. However not all rich nations follow suit. The role of developing countries is also crucial: in 2001 countries across Africa pledged to spend 15% of their national budgets on healthcare - only 8 have done so. <br><br>• Ineffective funding. Health funding comes through a variety of channels at different points in time, making it very difficult to plan for the future and to invest in the long-term projects needed to recruit and train health workers.  </p> <p>No child out of reach says that world leaders must realise that their unmet promises on health will costs lives.</p> <p>Brendan Cox continues: ‘Both rich and poor countries must put health workers at the top of their agenda. With more money to train urgently-needed nurses, midwives and community health workers around the world, we will save millions of children’s lives.”</p> <p>Ends</p> <p>For more interviews or more information please contact Save the Children’s media unit on +44 207 012 6841 / +44 7831 650 409</p> <p>We have spokespeople available in London, New York and Nigeria. </p> <p>Case studies, photography and b-roll are available</p> <p>Notes to editors: </p> <p>• Save the Children works in more than 120 countries.

The charity has already reached 16,200 people with vital aid supplies and is scaling up its efforts to reach one million people in total.</p> <p>The rains in the Sindh region are the worst in the 300 years records have been kept, with some towns getting as much rain in a day as they usually do in a year.

Parents are struggling to find food for their children and the materials for temporary shelters. </p> <p>David Wright, Save the Children’s Pakistan country director, said:</p> <p>“This is a desperately serious situation. The lives of children in Sindh are at risk from both malaria and new floodwaters contaminated by the sewage from several major towns. Families made homeless by the current flooding are already living in filthy conditions. At several camps a hundred people are sharing a single toilet. Many children in Sindh are already weak and malnourished – malaria or waterborne diseases could kill them within days. </p> <p>“Save the Children is distributing mosquito nets, soap and other hygiene items – aid that could mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of children.”</p> <p>Sindh’s usual peak season for malaria is October, but the vast expanses of standing water are a breeding ground for mosquitoes, so the mosquito season could start early and be much more intense than usual. </p> <p>In addition a major sewage canal, known as the LBOD canal, is at risk of bursting its banks. It takes most of the province’s sewage, and if it floods then tens of thousands of people will have to be evacuated.</p> <p>Save the Children is also providing food, emergency healthcare and shelter to families affected by the flooding.</p> <p>/ends</p> <p>Save the Children has been working in Pakistan for more than 30 years and is already supporting nearly seven million people in the country.</p> <p>For interviews or more information please contact Save the Children's media team, +44 (0) 207 012 6841 or out of hours on +44 (0)7831 650 409.<br> <br>Notes to editors</p> <p>Save the Children can host journalists in Mirpurkhas, one of the worst affected areas of Sindh, where over half the current flood deaths have occurred. </p> <p>Four mobile Save the Children teams are operating in Badin.<br>Food:<br>• Food assistance of 112 Metric tons has been provided to 1,300 households in district Badin. <br>Health:<br>• 1,576 patients provided emergency healthcare services. <br>Non-food items: <br>• NFIs team has distributed shelter, households and hygiene kits to 850 families in Badin.<br>• Thursday, 300 more families will receive NFI kits while one NFI team will move to Mirpurkhas.<br>Hygiene:<br>• 500 hygiene kits have been distributed to families and hygiene awareness training has reached 1,500 people including 453 children.<br>Child Protection<br>• Psychosocial support has been provided to 2,101 children (1,126 are boys and 975 girls) through recreational activities. <br> </p> <p><br> </p>"

Why Money Matters reveals how the government is set to break its promise to halve child poverty by 2010 unless it invests significant cash now.

He died ""on his way to fight for an improved education for the children of Chad"" she added.</p> <p>Everyone who knew Pascal talks of his drive and passion. One aid worker in Chad said: ""He had an energy and a big presence. He spoke with authority and his opinions were backed by experience.

In the end, he gave his life doing just that.</p> <p>""There are many human qualities that make truly great aid workers: leadership, courage, humility, honesty, resilience, empathy, tireless energy and a healthy sense of humour. He possessed all these in great measure.""</p> <p>Pascal was very much loved by all. We will always remember him and our memory of him will give us strength to carry on. We owe him that.</p> <h2>Save the Children in Chad</h2> <p><strong>Due to the escalating insecurity in eastern Chad — resulting in the killing of two staff members — Save the Children has been forced to temporarily suspend its activities. We are investigating the circumstances of these tragic incidents and re-assessing the security situation. </strong></p> <h2>The crisis in Chad</h2> <p>Nearly half a million people are currently living in camps in Chad. Repeated attacks on villages in the east of the country have forced approximately 180,000 Chadians to flee their homes. And the country is also now hosting over 300,000 refugees from Darfur and the Central African Republic. </p> <p>Many Darfuri refugees have been in Chad since fighting first broke out in Darfur in 2003. But thousands more have arrived following the recent fighting in both countries. Over 60 % of the refugees are thought to be children and many of the new arrivals are in desperate condition. Grouped together in camps, children and their families are living in basic shelters with little access to food, water and medical care. </p> <h2>What we’ve been doing </h2> <p>We've been working in eastern Chad in two camps in Aradip and Dogdore, for displaced Chadian people. We've also been working in Bredjing, a camp in eastern Chad for Darfuri refugees. </p> <p>We run education, child protection, nutrition and health programmes, as well as distributing emergency supplies, such as blankets and plastic sheeting, benefiting 35,000 children. </p> <h3>Education</h3> <p>We've been providing training for teachers, animators and local community leaders who are educating children living in the Adradip and Dogdore camps. We also provide recreational and educational activities for children, building temporary schools and distributing education materials. </p> <h3>Child protection</h3> <p>In Dogdore camp, we've established child friendly spaces and children's clubs where children can play with their friends and where support is provided to extremely vulnerable children. These children were identified through our child protection committees — local women, men and children who we've trained on child protection issues. </p> <p>We've also been advocating for local authorities to put better, more sustainable, child protection measures in place.</p> <h3>Healthcare and nutrition</h3> <p>Our primary healthcare programme in Brejding camp provides access to healthcare and nutrition services to 42,000 people — of which more than half are children below the age of 18. Services are provided to refugees as well as to villagers living around the camp. </p> <p>We also launched an innovative community-based therapeutic care project a year ago at the main hospital in the town of Abeche. The majority of children are now treated for malnutrition in their homes with visits from nutritionists, avoiding long stays at the hospital for treatment.<br></p><img height=182 alt=""Internally Displaced Person site near Koukou in eastern Chad.

"1038","/en/50_10792.htm","/get-involved/join-our-campaigns/museum-of-poverty","Museum of Poverty","If child poverty ended tomorrow, what items would be consigned forever to the archives of history? What would future generations look back on in shame, wondering how we let families live is such dire conditions?","<p>The Museum of Poverty highlights the impact of child poverty in Scotland. Below, children, young people and parents, who helped put the museum together, share their experiences of poverty.</p> <h2>Free school meals</h2> <p>“It’s not really free schooling because you need to pay for your kid to get something to eat, whether it’s pack lunches or whether it’s school meals. If every child in Scotland was to get a free school meal regardless of their parents’ income then that would help to eradicate child poverty, because even if you’re working you still struggle [to pay for the meals].”</p> <h2>Childcare</h2> <p>“I’ve had difficult issues before with childcare because I had to leave my last job when the summer holidays came up because I didn’t have nobody to watch the kids.”</p> <p>“It would cost as much anyway – you wouldn’t be any better off by the time you’ve paid your childcare. …So there is no incentive there.”</p> <h2>Fuel poverty</h2> <p>“Gas and electricity prices are higher for people who use a pre-payment card or key. …there needs to be money in and if you are even a day late in putting money in then you get charged and that starts a cycle of debt. It’s a case of either heating or food – one or the other.”</p> <h2>Doing without</h2> <p>“I’d be quite happy with an extra £30 or £20 a fortnight just to be able to treat myself to something nice, [to] be able to get my shopping and my electric [bill] to last me two weeks and then have enough to buy something that I never normally buy. Buying fruit and vegetables, that’s getting harder as well. I mean you’ve got these tokens, but you’ve got to be pregnant and on income support. Why can’t everyone have them tokens? We all need to eat fruit and vegetables so why can’t everybody have them?</p> <h2>Homelessness</h2> <p>“…If you can’t get in a hostel…you have to go to that place where you sleep in chairs all night. You sleep in chairs all night. You sleep in chairs and there’s nowhere to lie down. You stay there all night then at 8 in the morning you’re back up the Hamish Allan Centre, and if they can’t find you a hostel you’ll be doing that 2 or 3 nights in row – sleeping in a chair.”</p> <h2>Cheap processed food </h2> <p>“It’d be nice to have something to make a Sunday dinner – a proper big joint of meat with Yorkshire puddings and everything – but it’ll cost you too much money. You’ve got to live on the stuff that’s full of junk and full of fat because that’s all you can afford.”</p> <h2>Pawnbrokers</h2> <p>“A lot of people sell their wedding rings and I’m thinking about the people that are actually selling this at the pawnshop. If you’re going to buy a wedding ring out a pawn, you think of the history behind it, like somebody’s probably had a pure amazing wedding and they’ve just sold away the memory, the thing behind the memory, which is the ring.

We have received over 460,000 hats since April and we’re confident that we will reach our target of half a million by 21 October – the campaign’s final day. </p> <p>Messages and letters to Gordon Brown are also still piling in and we are beginning to collate them ready to present them to the Prime Minister by the end of 2008. As many as 40,000 knitters have taken part in the campaign and a big thank you to every single one of you for giving up your free time (and wool!) to help save children’s lives. The hats have been flying out the door in the last month and 400,000 have now been sent to countries in Africa and Asia where high numbers of children die before their fifth birthday. </p> <p>Recent shipments have included: 30,000 hats to Bangladesh; 25,000 hats to Liberia; and a massive 80,000 to Brazil. We are also about to send 50,000 hats directly to the Ministry of Health in Mongolia who plan to distribute them through every state hospital in the country. Closer to home, the Knit One, Save One team ran a stall at IKnit Day in London on 6 September. More than 2,000 people, young and old, came from all over the UK to attend the event and learn about all things knitting. </p> <p>We talked to hundreds of people about the campaign and were happy to discover that over half of them had already heard of it. We managed to recruit lots of new campaigners and, to our delight, we soon had a group of happy people sitting round the stall knitting hats.

They surpassed their target and the final total was 1,600 hats, which is amazing. </p> <p>They got their local MP Dan Rogerson involved. They even taught him to knit! The group wrapped the whole project up on Sunday 21 September when they held a church service to bless the hats. They even had a hat-shaped cake to celebrate their success! </p> <p>You can see the pictures below. A huge thank you to the Mothers’ Union in Newquay and all the groups around the country who have held events and gone to so much effort to promote the campaign. </p> <p> </p> <div id=""oct2"" class=""pics""> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Knit_Newquay_1.jpg""> <span><p>They covered the church in hats...</p></span> </div> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Knit_Newquay_2.jpg""> <span><p>...making sure not to miss a spot.</p></span> </div> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Knit_Newquay_3.jpg""> <span><p>The official campaign cake!</p></span> </div> </div> <div id=""oct2-caption"" class=""gallery-caption""></div> <ul id=""oct2-nav"" class=""pics-nav""></ul> <p> </p> <p>So it’s almost over.

When and where the hand-in will take place is still up in the air so watch this space for details. What we do know is that your hats have helped save the lives of hundreds of thousands of newborn babies. Now let’s hope that your voice will help to save millions more.

We have now received over 350,000 and a big thank you to all dedicated knitters for taking the time to take part in the campaign. </p> <p>It’s been an exciting month with a ‘Knit One, Save One’ <a title=""Knit One Save One campaign in The Sun"" href=""http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/article1544963.ece"">double page spread</a> going out in The Sun on 12 August. As well as including an overview of the campaign, The Sun also printed our hat label for people to cut out and send in with their hats. Thank you to all Sun readers for sending in lots of wonderful messages to the Prime Minister. </p> <p>The shipment of 10,000 hats that went to Kenya back in July have now arrived and Save the Children staff presented the woolly lifesavers to officials from the Kenyan Ministry of Health, explaining that the hats had been knitted by members of the British public who want to help children in countries like Kenya to survive. Whilst handing over this ‘hat petition’ we asked Kenyan officials to tell their own government to focus on Millennium Development Goal 4, which aims to reduce child mortality by two -thirds by 2015, when they attend the UN summit on the MDGs in September.</p> <p>During the Kenyan event, 300 hats were also presented to the district Hospital in Maragua to be distributed at the maternity ward. Maragua, in central Kenya, has extremely low breastfeeding rates and the woolly hats were used to launch an accelerated campaign to promote breastfeeding in and around the district. </p> <p>A total of 2,000 hats have also been presented to Kenyan provincial medical officers for distribution through hospitals with maternity services. This is a good opportunity to promote breastfeeding as one of the most simple and cost-effective ways of improving child survival. </p> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/Knitting_Kenya.jpg""></p> <p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11px"">A Kenyan baby sleeps under his hat. </p> <p>More shipments of hats have been flying out the building. 50,000 went to Afghanistan a week ago and they should arrive just before their harsh winter sets in in October. In addition, we just sent 20,000 hats to India which will mainly go to help victims of the recent floods. Look out for the news updates from these countries next month. </p> <p>Hats have also now arrived at their destination in South Africa. They have been given out to children who have fled Zimbabwe and are now living in refugee camps. We mainly work with older children in South Africa so we sent some of the bigger hats that people have knitted. As you can see from the pictures below these children seem to be loving their colourful woolly gifts. </p> <p> </p> <div id=""knitsa"" class=""pics""> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Knitting_SA_1.jpg""> <span><p>Looking extra special in purple.</p></span> </div> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Knitting_SA_2.jpg""> <span><p>A boy poses for the camera.</p></span> </div> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Knitting_SA_3.jpg""> <span><p>A girl looks warm as well as funky in her hat!</p></span> </div> </div> <div id=""knitsa-caption"" class=""gallery-caption""></div> <ul id=""knitsa-nav"" class=""pics-nav""></ul> <p> </p> <p>Many thanks to all the knitters.

The campaign ends on 21 October 2008 so make sure to send us your hats with your completed label attached before that date. </p> <p>There are three really important things to remember about the 'Knit One, Save One' campaign: </p> <ol> <li>Remember that the campaign ends on 21 October 2008 so don't send any more hats after that date. </li> <li>Make sure you complete your hat label to Prime Minster Gordon Brown and attach it to your hat before sending it to us. </li> <li>Please only send hats - not jumpers, booties or any other knitted items. If you have already sent in non-hats then we will do our best to use them but please don't send in any more. </li></ol> <p>Most importantly, remember that your hat can help us save a life. Your voice can help us save millions.</p> <h2>5 August </h2> <p>The campaign rolls on and the hats and messages to the Prime Minster continue to roll in. Of the 300,000 hats that have poured in through Save the Children’s doors since March, 220,000 of them have already been sent out to vulnerable babies in Africa and Asia. </p> <p>Thanks to the all wonderful Save the Children staff working on the ground who have made sure that the hats reach children who really need them. We really are saving lives, people!</p> <p>As you can see from our knit-o-meter (on the right), 25,000 people have taken part in the campaign so far, making us half-way to reaching our target of involving 50,000 knitters. Knit One, Save One ends on October 21 so we all have just two and a half months to get our friends and family involved. So get recruiting to show the government that the public want them to act now to save the lives of newborn babies around the world.</p> <p>The campaign had a big boost last week when Reckitt Benckiser, one of Save the Children’s extremely generous corporate sponsors, paid for the shipments of 50,000 hats to Tanzania and Angola. In Tanzania, where high numbers of newborn babies die from hypothermia, the hats are extremely welcome and will make a real difference. A huge thank you to Reckitt Benckiser for extending their considerable support to these two countries to help out the Knit One, Save One campaign.</p> <p>As well as sending shipments out to China, Myanmar (Burma) and Zimbabwe this week, we have also received photos back from our programme in Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone 270 out of every 1,000 children die before they reach their fifth birthday. That’s more than 1 in 4. It has worst child mortality rate in the world and we are so happy to be able to help. Check out these stories and pictures of tiny newborn babies in Sierra Leone sporting their life-saving woolly accessories.</p> <h2>Isha and Kadiatu's babies</h2><br> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/Knitting_Kroo_13783.gif""></p> <p>This baby boy was born at 11am at home by a traditional birth attendant in Kroo Bay, which is a slum town in Sierra Leone. In this picture he's just one and a half hours old. He's sporting one of the hats knitted by Save the Children supporters and distributed through the Kroo Bay clinic. His mum, Isha, has a fever and isn't well. Her sister, Mary, has come to the clinic to get the baby weighed and registered. Mary explains, ""The hat is good for the cold during the rainy season. A cold wind comes with the rain and brings problems for babies. They get very cold.""</p> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/Knitting_Kroo_13788.gif""></p> <p>Kadiatu's baby, Kadija, in one of the hats knitted by Save the Children supporters in the UK.

Hats are still flowing in like there’s no tomorrow and we have now reached the 200,000 mark. That’s 200,000 colourful, woolly gifts for happy mothers and tiny babies. </p> <p>As always, a big thank you to all you knitters out there who’ve made this happen. We would love to hear some of your wonderful knitting stories from the campaign; have you held a ‘knit-in’ event with friends or managed to get your local MP or community centre involved? Whatever your story we would love to hear about it so please email us at <a href=""mailto:campaigns@savethechildren.org.uk"">campaigns@savethechildren.org.uk</a>.</p> <p>In campaign news, we’ve received more stories and photos from our programme in Tibet who have been distributing the hats for the last few weeks. Here’s the story of Thupten Jigme who is now 4 months old and has already suffered from pneumonia. <h2>Thupten Jigme’s story</h2> <p>As we were approaching Medio township clinic, Kyizom and her four-months-old baby were already there along with many other parents and children in front of the only mud brick house of the township clinic in this open pastoral area. </p> <p>Even if it is mid summer, the weather was still quite cold as it was a rainy and windy day and the elder children were running about with the sheep and yaks, not only having fun but also keeping warm. But four-months-old Thupten Jigme was so tightly swaddled that he looked like a parcel ready to be sent somewhere. It was hard to imagine how he could breathe let alone generate body heat.</p> <p>Thupten Jigme had come to this world just four months back. His birth took place in a yak hair tent on a mountain slope while the family was grazing their animals. Kyizom, his mother recalls that the weather was much colder than now. What caught our attention at a glance was that Thupten Jigme was not wearing a hat. </p> <p>It was Kyizom and Thupten Jigme’s third visit to the clinic since the child got pneumonia and when asked about the cause Kyizom had no idea. She said, ‘I do everything to keep him healthy but he is still weak and gets sick very often’. After we put a hat on her baby’s head and explained in detail about the importance of it, she said ‘I never used to pay any attention to the relation between body heat loss and respiratory disease in small children and I am very happy to learn about the benefit of these baby hats.’</p> <p>Kyizom’s dream for Thupten Jigme is that he becomes a healthy and smart boy. He will be a well-educated herdsman in the future so that they will live a happy and prosperous life.” </p> <p>Here are some more pictures from Tibet including a photo of Kyizom and Thuptem Jigme. Look out for more stories from Tibet in the next update.</p> <h2>More cute babies and their hats</h2> <div id=""tibet2"" class=""pics""> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Tibet_hats_2_1.jpg""> <span>Thuptem Jigme enjoys his new hat whilst Kyizom proudly holds him.</span> </div> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Tibet_hats_2_2.jpg""> <span>Tibetan mothers are over the moon to receive the hats from Save the Children staff. </span> </div> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Tibet_hats_2_3.jpg""> <span>Father and son pose with their hats.</span> </div> <div> <img src=""/sites/default/files/Tibet_hats_2_4.jpg""> <span>Far too cute to need a caption!</span> </div> </div> <div id=""tibet2-caption"" class=""gallery-caption""></div> <ul id=""tibet2-nav"" class=""pics-nav""></ul> <p>Whilst hats were being distributed in the mountains of Tibet, back in the UK MPs have been knitting in the House of Commons at the campaign’s cross-party parliamentary knitting session held last week.</p> <p>The event coincided with the meeting of the G8 leaders in Tokyo and British MPs led by example by doing something tangible to save children’s lives.</p> <p>Sixteen MPs attended and tried their hand at knitting a hat, including Ed Balls, Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, who is a surprisingly good knitter although can’t cast on himself!</p> <p>Kerry McCarthy from the Department for International Development spoke about the importance of the campaign, as did Libby Rees, Save the Children’s youth ambassador.

In Stroud, Gloucestershire, David Drew MP met a committed Save the Children supporter to hand over more than 3,000 hats! We hope that MPs will continue to do their bit for the campaign.<br><br><img src=""/sites/default/files/knit_update_mp.gif""> <p style=""FONT-SIZE: 11px"">David Drew MP with the thousands of hats knitted by people in Stroud.</p> <p>On that note, our parliamentary knitting event is taking place next week in the House of Commons. It will coincide with the meeting of world leaders at the G8 and British MPs will be leading by example by doing something tangible to end child mortality. Come on G8 leaders, why don’t you do something too?</p> <p>Finally, our next shipment of hats is going out to South Africa in the next few days. It’s very cold out there already and the hats will be distributed in the new refugee camps that have sprung up around Johannesburg and Cape Town since the violence against immigrants began there. We are very happy to be able to make a small difference to the lives of mothers and babies struggling to survive.</p> <p>There are three really important things to remember about the 'Knit One, Save One' campaign:</p> <ol> <li>Please only send hats - not jumpers, booties or any other knitted items. If you have already sent in non-hats then we will do our best to use them but please don't send in any more. </li> <li>Make sure you complete your hat label to Prime Minster Gordon Brown and attach it to your hat before sending it to us. </li> <li>Remember that the campaign ends on 21 October 2008 so don't send any more hats after that date. </li></ol> <p>Most importantly, remember that your hat can help us save a life. Your voice can help us save millions.</p> <h2>6 June 2008</h2> <p>We are now two months into the campaign and so far have received an incredible 120,000 woolly hats! </p> <p>In this update, we would've liked to have brought you news and pictures of Tibetan babies wearing your hats but, unfortunately, our shipment has been held up in Shanghai. Save the Children staff in China are sorting out the delay and you should have stories and photos of cute babies in hats by the end of June. Fingers crossed! </p> <p>Excitingly, our biggest shipment of 50,000 hats to Angola is ready to go out next week where they will keep newborn babies warm and snug. Four million babies die each year in their first month and Angola, in South-West Africa, has the second highest rate of child deaths in the world with 260 children out of every 1000 (or over 1 in 4) not reaching their fifth birthday. </p> <p>Over the last few weeks we have been getting MPs involved in the campaign and they seem to love it as much as you do! Many MPs are choosing to collect hats from their constituents to present to local Save the Children supporters and volunteers. Others will be attending our Knitting Circle event in Parliament. Date to be confirmed so watch this space! <a title=""Knitting ad in House - parliamentary magazine"" href=""/en/docs/house_ad_2nd_proof.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Check out our advert in House</a> (PDF 223KB), the parliamentary magazine. </p> <p>Our <a href=""/knit-one-save-one-photo-gallery"">online hat gallery</a> has now launched so you can see some of your beautiful craftwork and read heartfelt messages to Gordon Brown from knitters around the country. </p> <p>Once again, a huge thank you to all those who have already taken part and given their time to help save children's lives.

Seven provinces were affected. The earthquake was felt in Beijing - and even 18,000km away in Bangkok. Thousands of adults and children were left trapped under mounds of debris.At the time of writing, official statistics have declared more than 69,000 people dead, 370,000 injured and 18,000 still missing.</p> <p>The government responded rapidly and deployed over 50,000 troops in an immediate search and rescue operation but the devastation was so immense <strong>that the government asked Save the Children to support their work</strong> and help local organisations protect children and provide healthcare and education.</p> <p><strong>Children have been badly affected.</strong> The earthquake hit at 2.28pm on a school day, meaning thousands of schools collapsed or suffered severe damage while children were still inside.

Save the Children's role is to add the expertise and experience we have gained from around the world, and from inside China itself, to help rebuild children’s confidence and wellbeing,"" says Wyndham James, our Country Director. ""It's important that we leave a legacy of learning, for the future, about how to help children and families rebuild their lives.""</p> <p>Children need to play, learn and get help to express themselves to be able to overcome their experiences. <strong>We've set up six spaces where they can come and play safely with other children</strong> while their parents try to rebuild their lives. So far, 990 children have benefited from these areas in Mianzhu, Qingchuan and An counties. We'll be setting up another ten spaces throughout the affected areas.</p> <p><strong>We're supplying temporary schools with desks, blackboards, chairs and other equipment, and training teachers</strong> to give children emotional support. So far, we've reached more than 11,000 school children. We're also working with local community groups to provide younger, pre-school children with care and activities.</p> <p>We've set up a health programme for children under two and built baby-bathing stations where mothers can get clean water and just spend time with their babies, away from their camps. Our first baby-bathing station opened on 12 June and 60 babies were brought in on its first day.

"1306","/en/2499.htm","/what-we-do/chronic-malnutrition-key-questions","Chronic malnutrition: key questions","","<rde-dm:query searchable=""true"" > <h2>1. What is chronic malnutrition?</h2> <p>Children who suffer from chronic malnutrition fail to grow to their full genetic potential, both mentally and physically. The main symptom of this measured is stunting - shortness in height compared to others of the same age group - and takes a relatively long time to develop. There is a critical window for a child's optimal physical and mental growth and development, from when it is still in its mother's womb and during its first two years of life. Efforts to intervene during this period to counter the effects of malnutrition can reverse the harm it causes, but if the opportunity is missed, the child will never make up the difference in growth and development, and will be adversely affected for the rest of his/her life.</p> <h2>2. What causes chronic malnutrition?</h2> <p>Chronic malnutrition can result from a variety of factors that can negatively affect child growth. These will vary according to the specific circumstances in which each child has been raised, and constellations of factors may exist which interact negatively to worsen the problem. These include a child's weight at birth, how they are fed as infants, whether they suffer frequent bouts of disease, the quality of their diet and nutritional intake, their mother's nutritional status at conception and during pregnancy, environmental hygiene, their mother's education and inadequate or inattentive care as a young child.</p> <p>However, bigger global factors underpin these more immediate causes by limiting and undermining people's abilities to grow or earn sufficient amounts to feed themselves. These root causes of hunger include chronic poverty, unfair global trade rules and practices, poor management of agriculture by governments and climate change, which can all make even basic self-sufficiency and ability to survive in precarious conditions impossible, and HIV/AIDS and conflict, which often impact on the most productive members of society through death and displacement.</p> <h2>3. What happens to children who are stunted?</h2> <p>Chronic malnutrition will have severe consequences which affect the child for the rest of its life. It significantly increases the likelihood of premature death, and those who do survive are at much greater risk from a variety of afflictions including heart disease, diabetes and kidney damage, and are far less able to withstand infection. Failure to grow and reduced body size can also result in a lower physical capacity and energy for work as an adult, with associated economic costs. Malnutrition, through insufficient supply of both macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) and certain micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc.), also has major long-term negative impacts on brain and nerve development and function, including on mental skills and activity, physical movement and coordination and the acquisition of skills needed to interact well socially. This damage tends to be reflected in lower IQs and poorer performance at school. Those who were chronically malnourished as children and eventually in turn become parents themselves can pass it on to the next generation in an ongoing cycle, as mothers with low body weight in turn give birth to small babies.</p> <h2>4. How much mortality is caused by malnutrition?</h2> <p>Every year, over 10 million children under the age of 5 die globally; malnutrition is directly or indirectly associated with more than half of these deaths. It is the main contributor to illness and disease in the world through diet-related risk factors such as micronutrient deficiencies, and undernutrition, the underlying cause for many of the principal child killers including diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria, measles and AIDS. Malnutrition compromises child immunity such that episodes of illness tend to last longer or be more severe, and interacts with infection in a negative vicious cycle, each worsening the effect of the other.</p> <h2>5. How many stunted children are there in the world and where is the problem the greatest?</h2> <p>According to UNICEF, there were an estimated 170 million stunted children living in developing countries in 2005. South Asia is the region with the highest percentage of its under-5 population stunted. Burundi's population has the most severe level of chronic malnutrition, but India has the largest absolute number of stunted children. </p>"

When war is over, schools are often destroyed and teachers killed so there is no longer a school for children to attend. Where schools do exist, resources are scarce, classes are overcrowded and teachers are untrained.</p> <p>Two years ago Save the Children launched its global campaign Rewrite the Future which is focused on securing quality education for the millions of children out of school due to conflict and violence. Rewrite the Future pledges to:</p> <ul> <li>Ensure that 3 million out-of-school children gain access to good-quality education in conflict-affected countries by 2010. </li> <li>Improve the quality of existing education programmes for a further 5 million children.</li></ul> <p>Since 2006, Save the Children has rebuilt schools, supplied school materials and protected children from abuse and exploitation, paving the way for a durable change in the lives of almost 6 million children.</p> <p>Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, Secretary General of the International Save the Children Alliance commented: “<q>We are very pleased to announce this global partnership with Bulgari. Their commitment and support for education is one of the most valuable ways to make a difference to children’s lives in war afflicted countries.</q>”</p>"

"1430","/en/haiti-qanda.htm","/haiti-qanda","Q&A: Haiti earthquake","","<h2>How is Save the Children responding?</h2> <p>Our team on the ground is already assessing the damage. We’re procuring supplies including shelter materials, sanitation kits (containing soaps and detergents), and essential household items (including cooking utensils and blankets). </p> <h2>When will we start distributing aid?</h2> <p>We hope to start delivering supplies by this Friday or Saturday – 15 or 16 January.</p> <h2>What form will our response take?</h2> <p>This will be a major emergency response and will probably include:</p> <ul> <li>providing tarpaulins for shelter, and blankets and mats </li> <li>delivering hygiene kits </li> <li>creating safe spaces for children where they can play and spend time properly looked after by trained professionals, who will help them recover from their trauma </li> <li>reuniting children separated from their parents </li> <li>delivering food and clean water </li> <li>building temporary schools, health facilities and toilets.</li></ul> <h2>What problems are we facing?</h2> <p>The island is mountainous, small and densely populated, making movement through the shattered streets very difficult. We’re using motorbikes, as the roads are impassable by car.</p> <p>There is no electricity in Port-au-Prince making communication difficult. We’re currently communicating via satellite phones.</p> <p>The airport is closed, hampering the effort to bring in essential supplies. And given the social and political instability in the country, the threat of rioting and looting is considerable.</p> <p>Our office been damaged and 20 of our staff remain unaccounted for. Their safety is of paramount concern for us.</p> <h2>What are the most pressing humanitarian needs?</h2> <p>Shelter, access to clean water, sanitation and healthcare are of immediate and critical importance to the thousands of people affected. Thousands of children may have lost or been separated from their parents, and desperately need help and protection if they’re living on the streets.</p> <p>We’re also very worried about the prospect of an outbreak of disease given the lack of clean water or medical help and that so many live close together in Port-au-Prince.</p> <p>The rate of malnutrition among children is likely to rocket leaving them even more vulnerable to disease. Already one-quarter of children under five in Haiti are chronically malnourished.</p> <h2>How will we work with other relief agencies in Haiti?</h2> <p>As in all our emergency responses, Save the Children will work alongside aid agencies from across the world, in a response coordinated by the UN, to meet the urgent needs of those affected.</p> <h2>Background</h2> <ul> <li>Officially the population of Port au Prince is 1 million, but the real figure could be as high as 3 million because of the large number of unofficial slums. Very densely populated, the city is built on the side of mountain so the risk of landslides is high. </li> <li>There is huge inequality in Haiti. The poorest people live in the most vulnerable regions in the worst conditions, such as on the steep slopes of the mountains outside Port au Prince. It is feared whole communities fell off these mountain slopes during the quake. </li> <li>There are an estimated 6,800 unaccompanied children begging on the streets of the capital alone. Known as ‘cockroaches’, these children are forced by poverty-stricken families onto the streets to make a living. They’re extremely vulnerable to abuse and trafficking. </li> <li>The cities of Haiti have the biggest slums in the northern hemisphere. They are also among the most densely populated. For example in the slums of St Martin, 50,000 people live in a space 1 kilometre square. </li> <li>There are few roads in these slums, only narrow alleyways through densely packed three- or four-story buildings. In the aftermath of an earthquake, these areas are likely to be impenetrable. </li> <li>Haiti is particularly prone to flooding. The island was deforested to make way for farming. But little can now be grown in nutrient-drained soil and the land is extremely prone to landslides and flooding. </li> <li>There are drainage canals designed to carry water from the mountains around Port au Prince through the city and slums into the sea. These are likely to have been destroyed by the quake and will need to be rebuilt as soon as possible to prevent flooding during the rainy season. </li> <li>Haiti has a history of hundreds of years of violent unrest. It also has a dominant gang culture, particularly in the cities – urban slums in Haiti are effectively under gang control. There’s a high incidence of violent crime. Haiti also has very high rates of drug abuse, prostitution and child trafficking. Unaccompanied children are at risk of abuse. </li> <li>Save the Children has worked in Haiti since 1985, primarily in Port au Prince and the Central Plateau region, providing health, education, protection and food security programmes to vulnerable children.</li></ul> <p></p>"
