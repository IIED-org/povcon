AWF?s programme in Africa is designed around the concept of the ?African Heartlands?, large conservation landscapes which are managed and conserved in an integrated fashion to optimize conservation value and human benefit. Founded 50 years ago, AWF now works in nine priority Heartlands across parts of fourteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa, delivering a combination of land management, conservation enterprise, capacity building & training, applied ecology and policy level conservation actions in partnership with national and local government, community and private sector organisations. Headquartered in Kenya, AWF is highly regarded for its conservation strategy, its African leadership and its practical approach to delivering real impact on the ground. A key focus of AWF?s activities is to provide enterprise services in and around the African Heartlands to assist communities in developing alternative and sustainable enterprises as a source of income while helping to conserve natural habitats.","1.
