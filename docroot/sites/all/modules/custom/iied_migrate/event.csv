With financial support from Swedbio, a two day workshop was held on 18th - 19th July 2007 in Cambridge, UK, at which representatives from a range of conservation and development organisations and academia gathered to share experiences of the application of socio-economic/livelihoods M&E. Focused around a series of presentations and discussion sessions, the goal of the workshop was to identify pragmatic recommendations and guidelines for conservation practitioners, that balance technical rigour with field realities. Some 40 delegates spanning 20 nationalities participated in the workshop. These included conservation field practitioners from 14 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, as well as those working in organisational headquarters on organisation-wide processes for M&E, reporting and lesson-learning. The involvement of selected representatives from the development sector, which has a longer history and experience of using and developing socio-economic/livelihoods M&E tools and processes, provided a valuable counterpoint to the discussion. The first day focused on comparing field level M&E tools and frameworks, whilst the second day focused on organisational process for M&E and reporting, and the challenges of reconciling field level, organisational and donor information requirements in a unified M&E system. Both days included presentations from conservation and development practitioners, and breakout discussion groups to explore key issues.","en","D0097","M0001",,".  measuring the socio economic impacts of conservation three international conservation organisations fauna & flora international the african wildlife foundation and birdlife international organised a workshop to explore the challenges and solutions",,,NULL,NULL

At the same time, targets to reduce human poverty worldwide are also off track. This dual challenge has led to a search for effective mechanisms and entry points through which conservation and development objectives can be addressed together. This paper discusses why working with local organisations can be an important entry point for conservation and poverty reduction, describes the global experience of BirdLife International in this context, and concludes with a discussion, based on BirdLife's experience, of some of the issues and constraints which need to be taken into account when addressing conservation and poverty reduction through working with local organisations.</p><BR><h1>New PCLG Briefing now available: <A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20110419-PCLG_Briefing_April_2011.pdf\" target=_blank>'Biodiversity Conservation and Development Assistance: Highlights from CBD CoP10'</A></h1></p><BR><h1>Other key documents:</h1><BR><h1><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101108-CBD-ts-55.pdf\" target=_blank>'Linking Biodiversity Conservation and Poverty Alleviation: A State of Knowledge Review'</A></h1>Two “state of knowledge” reviews were commissioned to explore the evidence base for two common assumptions about the link between biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction: 1) that the poor depend on biodiversity; and 2) that biodiversity conservation can be a mechanism for poverty reduction.

Changing patterns in land use, over-exploitation, pollution, climate change and the threat posed by invasive species, all challenge the way we currently manage and conserve biological diversity. Consequently, there are increasing numbers of conflicts between those interested in conserving species and those with alternative goals, interests or values. These conflicts occur over a range of scales from the local management of single species to international conflicts over the management of resources; they are multi-dimensional, involving ecological, social and economic interests and operate within political and legal frameworks. This conference brings together academics from a range of disciplines, policy makers and practitioners to address how, when and why conflicts arise, and to identify mitigation strategies.","en",,,"http://www.aces-2011.org",".  aces 2011 conservation conflicts strategies for coping with a changing world as human pressures on the planet increase biodiversity is under growing pressure across the world changing patterns in land use over exploitation pollution climate change",,,NULL,NULL

Some of the issues that will be addressed during this meeting are: whether IPBES is the best tool to improve biodiversity decision-making, how will it be managed, how will it work, etc. A major input for this meeting will be a document that analyzes the existing mechanisms and institutional gaps for making data and scientific information on biodiversity and ecosystems available to decision-makers. This is a unique opportunity for civil society to insert its views, particularly on the need for a credible, legitimate and relevant scientific interface on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Topics include but are not limited to: General trends in market-based environmental policies and instruments; New forms of neoliberal conservation (including web 2.0, species banking, etc); The relation between conservation and land (including protected areas, etc.); Ecological imperialisms, including the recent ‘land grabs’.

Around 30 participants from a variety of ape range states in Africa shared their experience on engaging communities, generating income and reducing poverty; visited community enterprises and conservation programmes in the local area; and learned about opportunities associated with REDD, mainstreaming poverty and environment, and forest governance. The group was keen to continue collaborating as a great apes chapter of the PCLG, with ambitions to establish national level chapters in a number of countries. The members identified a wide range of follow up activities at national, regional and international levels from practical work on human wildlife conflict to policy advocacy.</p><BR><UL><BR><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/Masindi_Workshop_Report-Final.pdf\" target=_blank>'Masindi workshop report'</A><BR></p>The presentations from the symposium are available to view below.<BR><h1>Overviews</h1><BR><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Roe-Sandbrook.pdf\" target=_blank>'Linking great ape conservation and poverty: Experiences from Africa'</A><BR>Dilys Roe, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), UK<BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Sunderland.pdf\" target=_blank>'Linking great apes and poverty: the case of orangutans in Asia'</A><BR>Terry Sunderland, Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Indonesia<BR></p><h1>Theme 1: Engaging poor communities in conservation</h1><BR><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Imong.pdf\" target=_blank>'Engaging communities in Cross River Gorilla conservation in Nigeria'</A><BR>Inaoyom Imong, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Nigeria<BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Bikaba.pdf\" target=_blank>'Engaging poor communities in conservation – what works, what doesn’t and why?'</A><BR>Dominique Bikaba, Strong Roots (SRC), DRC<BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Ndagijimana.pdf\" target=_blank>'Community interventions around the Volcanoes National Park'</A><BR>Felix Ndagijimana, Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund/Karisoke Research Center (DFGFI/KRC), Rwanda<BR></p><h1>Theme 2: Income generation and revenue sharing schemes</h1><BR><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Dupain.pdf\" target=_blank>'Participatory planning and scientific tourism in the Reserve de Faune de Lomoko Yokokala'</A><BR>Jef Dupain, African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), DRC<BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Ajarova.pdf\" target=_blank>'Conserving Uganda’s Productive Landscapes For Ecosystem Services: The Northern Albertine Rift Chimpanzee Corridor'</A><BR>Lilly Ajarova, Chimpanzee Sanctuary & Wildlife Conservation Trust (CSWCT), Uganda<BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Namara.pdf\" target=_blank>'Gorilla Conservation and Poverty: Experiences from Bwindi and Mgahinga Conservation area (BMCA), Uganda'</A><BR>Agrippinah Namara, Consultant, Uganda<BR></p><h1>Theme 3: Learning from other experiences</h1><BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Daconto.pdf\" target=_blank>'Linking Conservation & Development: emerging lessons from ICDPs in the Virungas'</A><BR>Giuseppe Daconto, CARE International, Rwanda<BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Blomley.pdf\" target=_blank>'Making community forestry work for the poor: Lessons from Nepal and Tanza'</A><BR>Tom Blomley, Acacia Natural Resource Consultants, UK<BR></p><A HREF=\"http://povertyandconservation.info/docs/20101115-Roe.pdf\" target=_blank>'What works for poverty reduction?
