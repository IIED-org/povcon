The core focus of PEI is to support country-led efforts to integrate the environmental concerns of poor and vulnerable groups into policy and planning processes for poverty reduction and pro-poor growth. With both financial and technical support, UNDP and UNEP assist government decision-makers and a wide range of other stakeholders to manage the environment in a way that improves livelihoods and leads to sustainable growth. The PEI works with key government partners to raise awareness, influence policymaking and strengthen the mainstreaming of poverty-environment into budget processes, sector programmes and sub-national planning. The overall aim is to bring about lasting institutional change and to catalyse key actors to increase investment in pro-poor environmental and natural resource management.","The UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment Initiative has jointly supported the implementation of country level mainstreaming programmes in nine countries in Africa and two countries in Asia and the Pacific with the aim of increasing the capacity of governments to mainstream environment into national development processes and their implementation. Although all country programmes are similar in that they all employ the three-phased approach with the aim of developing a sustainable poverty-environment mainstreaming programme, each country programme is tailored to the specific needs and conditions of that country. Therefore the time-frame and the activities carried out under each programme can vary from country to country. <BR>The scale-up of the PEI is focused on building on the strengths of the current country programmes on a regional basis. In Africa, the PEI is aiming to add several more countries to the regional programme in the coming few years. Support to PEI country programmes is provided through the regional structures of UNDP and UNEP. <BR>As of 2010, the PEI is supporting programmes in 22 countries.<BR>PEI has had a long running involvement in great ape conservation and poverty reduction projects in Africa:<BR>?	PEI completed its first phase (mainstreaming environment into the PRSP) in Rwanda in 2007. The current focus is on capacity building at all levels of government. PEI in general is not considered to focus much on biodiversity, but in the Rwandan case there is considerable attention to this issue, particularly through mountain gorillas and tourism. <BR>?	Following successful integration of environmental issues into the PRSP, the current phase of PEI in Tanzania is focussed on capacity building, improving access to and utilisation of poverty-environment data and financing environmental targets in the Mkukuta PRSP. <BR>?	The overall objective of the PEI in Uganda is to integrate environmental concerns into policies, plans, programmes and budgeting processes both at local and national levels.

Its aim is to ensure the conservation of mountain gorillas and their regional afromontane forest habitat in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).<BR>IGCP’s ultimate aim is to protect the afromontane forest and the many species it harbours, by ensuring that it is managed sustainably and by tackling the threats to its survival. In order to achieve this goal, it has set itself twin objectives: to reduce the threats to mountain gorillas and their forest habitat by creating widespread support for conservation among local communities, interest groups and the general public; and to improve the protection of gorillas and their habitat by encouraging the relevant authorities to adopt a consistent, collaborative approach to conservation policy and legislation throughout the region.<BR>There is a growing recognition among conservationists that a regional, ecosystem-based approach to management is crucial to effective long-term species and habitat protection, particularly in areas of political instability. One of IGCP’s main objectives is to increase collaboration between the protected area authorities and their partners in the region. The programme provides a mechanism for the respective countries to develop a regional approach to the conservation of a shared habitat.","1. As part of its Improving Livelihoods programme, IGCP has several projects in eastern DRC. The feasibility of developing a community tourism lodge is being explored but depends on improved security in the area. IGCP has worked with the Union des Apiculteurs du Secteur Mikeno et Nyamulagira to develop beekeeping skills and relocate hives outside the Virunga NP. Honey and other bee products are now sold to boost income. IGCP has also helped solicit donations from the World Food Programme to meet basic survival needs in eastern DRC. Help has been given to local people to build a 1 meter high stone wall around PN Virunga to reduce crop raiding and human-wildlife conflict. Meetings have been held to promote community participation in conservation management.<BR>2. IGCP is very active working with communities around PN Volcans in Rwanda, home to mountain gorillas, on alternative livelihoods projects such as beekeeping. One such project is the upmarket tourist development Sabinyo lodge, which is operated by the private sector but owned by SACOLA, a community institution they helped to found. This was funded with money from USAID and the private sector partner. In 2009 the revenue generated was $300,000, of which $270,000 went back to the community (albeit shared between 300,000 people). IGCP works with the Forum des Apicultuers des Volcans to promote apiculture around PNV, and has helped to build a stone wall to reduce crop raiding from buffaloes and other animals.<BR>3. IGCP is very active in Uganda, and has poverty alleviation as a major focus of its work around Bwindi and Mgahinga NPs, based on the rationale that poverty is a major threat to the conservation status of the parks and the mountain gorillas living in them. IGCP has supported various Integrated Conservation and Development interventions in the area, including support for community based tourism enterprises, alternative livelihoods such as beekeeping, and institutional support for the revenue sharing programme that is designed to ensure local people benefit from park tourism fees.

About 180 policy relevant research outputs including peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and discussion papers were produced during 2007-2009. Additionally, centers have also produced quite a number of reports, proceedings, news articles and policy briefs between 2007 and 2009.<BR>The EfD centers were not only producing and publishing research outcomes but they have also brought some policy impacts through their research activities. In a short time, the EfD centers have become key academic sources of policy advice. For instance, the Central American center has worked jointly with local and international organisations to construct a standardized methodology for setting entrance fees to the Costa Rican protected areas. This will enable the government to generate sustainable income to sustainably manage protected areas. The Ethiopia center has, with its sustainable land management (SLM) stakeholder analysis study, affected the allocation of resources for up-scaling and demonstrating SLM benefits from low to high potential areas of the Ethiopian highlands. The social capital and technology adoption study by Kenyan center has helped rural farmers for government to reintro duced extension services which were stopped for long time. This policy outreach is further strengthened by specific dissemination activities.<BR>Academic training is an integral part of the program. By strengthening the quality and the policy relevance of the academic programs, it is expected that the future impact of environmental economics will be greatly enhanced. This link is a prerequisite for all the centers and hundreds of students are being trained every year at undergraduate, MSc and PhD levels. EfD funds are primarily used to make MSc and PhD theses more policy relevant by linking them to the policy concerns of key ministries.","002-014-231|002-014-404|002-018-710|002-014-834|019-013-|142-030-156|","200700","0","EfD Central America<BR>Dr. Francisco Alpízar<BR>Email: falpizar@catie.ac.cr<BR> <BR>EfD China<BR>Professor Jintao Xu<BR>Email: xujt@pku.edu.cn<BR> <BR>EfD Ethiopia<BR>Dr. Alemu Mekonnen<BR>Email: alemu_m2004@yahoo.com<BR> <BR>EfD Kenya<BR>Dr. Wilfred Nyangena<BR>Email: wnyangena@kippra.or.ke<BR> <BR>EfD South Africa<BR>Dr. Martine Visser<BR>Email: martine.visser@uct.ac.za<BR> <BR>EfD Tanzania<BR>Dr. Razack Lokina<BR>Email: razack_lokina@yahoo.co.uk<BR> <BR>EfD Director: <BR>Gunnar Köhlin<BR>gunnar.kohlin@economics.gu.se, + 46 31 786  44 26<BR> <BR>EfD Communications: <BR>Karin Backteman<BR>karin.backteman@economics.gu.se, + 46 31 786 25 95<BR>EfD Partner -

"35","I0052","Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas Registry","O0091/COU|O0146/DOU|O0026/COU|","1","Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs) are a globally significant type of managed area governed by local or indigenous communities for conservation and cultural purposes. Their contributions to biodiversity conservation, sustainable livelihoods, and climate change adaptation are significantly under-studied and documented. The purpose of this project is to build a knowledge base about these special areas by documenting their values, enhancing understanding and recognition of their purposes and impacts, and increasing engagement of local and traditional communities in biodiversity conservation and policy. Together, partners are working to ensure that this process is participatory, transparent, and adhering to free, prior informed consent. This project will follow the guidance provided by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, established in September 2007, to ensure rights are maintained. Extra attention is given to building this process in line with existing local, national and regional processes.","The ICCA Registry project aims to build awareness and recognition of ICCAs through the development of a participatory registry and dedicated website. In May 2010, an ICCA Registry Handbook was launched as a guide for those involved with ICCAs who wish to participate in the ICCA Registry project. It also provides a general overview for others to learn about ICCAs. It contains information on the importance of ICCAs, benefits of the ICCA Registry, and detailed steps on contributing to and using the Registry. Case studies for several sites give a sense of the range of different ICCAs and their roles. A website was also created to feature an interactive map and case studies from four countries, Fiji, Mexico, Philippines and Kenya, as well as the mechanism for ICCA communities to register.",,"200800","0","Colleen Corrigan, Senior Programme Officer, Protected Areas<BR>Email: colleen.corrigan@unep-wcmc.org<BR>Phone: +44 1223 277 314 ext 282","http://www.iccaregistry.org",".  indigenous and community conserved areas registry indigenous and community conserved areas iccas are a globally significant type of managed area governed by local or indigenous communities for conservation and cultural purposes their contributions to biodiversity conservation sustainable livelihoods and climate change adaptation are significantly under studied and documented the purpose of this project is to build a knowledge base about these special areas by documenting their values enhancing understanding and recognition of their purposes and impacts and increasing engagement of local and traditional communities in biodiversity conservation and policy together partners are working to ensure that this process is participatory transparent and adhering to free prior informed consent this project will follow the guidance provided by the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples established in september 2007 to ensure rights are maintained extra attention is given to building this process in line with existing local national and regional processes the icca registry project aims to build awareness and recognition of iccas through the development of a participatory registry and dedicated website in may 2010 an icca registry handbook was launched as a guide for those involved with iccas who wish to participate in the icca registry project it also provides a general overview for others to learn about iccas it contains information on the importance of iccas benefits of the icca registry and detailed steps on contributing to and using the registry case studies for several sites give a sense of the range of different iccas and their roles a website was also created to feature an interactive map and case studies from four countries fiji mexico philippines and kenya as well as the mechanism for icca communities to register colleen corrigan senior programme officer protected areas email colleen corrigan unep wcmc org phone 44 1223 277 314 ext 282  .",,,NULL,NULL
